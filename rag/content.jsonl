In percentage terms, this stands at 2.21 %. There has been a marginal increase in the differently-abled population in India, with the figure rising from 21.9 million in 2001 to 26.8 million in 10 years. There are 14.9 million men with disabilities as compared to 11.8 million women in the country. The total number of differently-abled people is over 18 million in the rural areas and just 8.1 million enumerated in the urban settings. The percentage of men with disabilities is 2.41 as against 2.01 in women. Social groups wise analysis shows, 2.45 per cent of the total disabled population belong to the Scheduled Castes, 2.05 to the Scheduled Tribes and 2.18 per cent to other than SC/ST. Even among these two social groups, the proportion of men with disabilities is higher as compared to women. State-wise data shows, , Maharashtra, Orissa and Jammu and Kashmir have more than 2.51 per cent disabled population whereas in , Assam, Meghalaya, Assam and Nagaland, the percentage is less than 1.75. For State/ UT wise Persons with Disability statistics, Over 5.4 million people have some kind of physical disability, followed by hearing impairment affecting 5.07 million and 5.03 million who have problems with their vision. Just about 2 million have speech disability, and 2 million are affected by mental retardation and other mental illnesses. The proportion of women suffering from seeing, hearing and multiple disabilities is higher than men. Disability in seeing, hearing and movement and multiple disability is more among STs than SCs and others while disability in speech and mental retardation is more among others than SC/ST. Age-wise break-up of the data suggests disability is more among people aged 80 years and above, and the least among children aged up to 4 years. Disability among STs in lower age groups up to 40-49 years is significantly lower than the other social groups whereas in the higher age group (60 plus), it is high among STs. Census 2011 data on Disabled Population in the age-group 5-19 by their Attendance Status in Educational Institutions and type of Disability indicates that there are about 65.7 lakh disabled population in age-group 5-19, out of which 40.2 lakh (61.2%) are attending educational institutions, 8.0 lakh (12.1%) attended educational institutions earlier and 17.5 lakh (26.7%) never attended any educational institutions. Further, out of 40.2 lakh disabled persons attending educational institutions, 22.8 lakh (56.7%) are males and 17.4 lakh (43.3%) are females. As such, there is an improvement of about 11 percentage points in the status of attending educational institutions by disabled persons in the age-group 5-19 during the decade 2001-2011.

The proportion of disabled persons, who never attended any educational institution in 2011 was found to be highest among persons with ‘Multiple disability’ (54.4%), followed by ‘Mental illness’ (50.3%) and ‘Mental retardation’ (41.2%) whereas persons with ‘Any other disability’ (17.7%) show the least percentage. The Constitution of India ensures equality, freedom, justice and dignity of all individuals and implicitly mandates an inclusive society for all, including persons with disabilities. The Constitution in the schedule of subjects lays direct responsibility of empowerment of disabled persons on the State governments. Therefore, the primary responsibility to empower the disabled rests with the State governments. Under Article 253 of the Constitution read with item No. 13 of the Union List, the Government of India enacted ‘The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995’, in an effort to ensure equal opportunities for persons with disabilities and their full participation in nation-building. The Act extends to the whole of India, except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The Government of Jammu and Kashmir has separately enacted ‘The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights & Full Participation) Act, 1998’. A multi-sectoral collaborative approach, involving all the appropriate governments, i.e., ministries of the Central Government, the State Governments/UTs, Central/State undertakings, local authorities and other appropriate authorities is being followed in the implementation of various provisions of the Act. India is a signatory to the ‘Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People’ with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region. India is also a signatory to the Biwako Millennium Framework working towards an inclusive, barrier free and rights-based society.

{"content": "The creation of a distinct government agency for the divyang was approved by the Maharashtra state government (differently abled) during 2022. The same was announced on the occasion of the International Day of Disabled Persons 2022. This comes after 20 years of calls for the creation of a special department to oversee the care and safety of those with disabilities. The first state in India to have a distinct department for Divyang (differently-abled) is Maharashtra. This agency was created to provide professional and educational support to the state's residents who are both physically and mentally challenged. It aims to guarantee the Divyangs' wellbeing and successfully carry out a number of government initiatives aimed at them. A total budget of Rs. 1,143 crores has been allocated for the new department, which has up to 2,063 new positions. Previously, the Social Justice Department, which is overseen by the Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment, had jurisdiction over all grievances and matters relating to people with disabilities. The Social Justice and Special Assistance department's sections that deal with issues affecting individuals with disabilities will all be combined to establish the Divyang department. All programmes put into place for the divyangs will be consolidated under one roof. There are currently about 2.5 crore persons with disabilities living in the state. They will receive assistance from the new department with regard to health, travel, education, employment, scholarships, and rehabilitation. A total of 2,000 specialised trainers for various disabilities are to be hired. In 1992, a resolution proclaiming the International Day of Disabled Persons was approved by the United Nations General Assembly. Every year on December 3, this day is marked to increase public awareness of the problems and difficulties that persons with disabilities encounter. It aims to protect the rights, welfare, and overall dignity of people with disabilities. Last Modified : 11/22/2023 This topic provides information about Sewa Mitra P...

{"content": "Rehabilitation of hearing impaired persons (children/adults) is a challenge and requires special attention from a team of professionals attached to Govt. and/or Voluntary Organizations and a team of Community Level Workers. The quality of life of persons with disabilities can only be improved when there is a close coordination, collaboration and cooperation between the community members including persons with disabilities, their parents/family members/friends and Govt. and/or voluntary organizations. To meet the rehabilitation needs of persons with disabilities the community effective participation is necessary as the community has a big role to play in the whole process of rehabilitation of persons with disabilities. There could be a number of matters which are required to be looked into at different stages of life of persons with disabilities and thus the focus should be on what is important at a particular stage for persons with disabilities. The parents of children should be provided support and advice to identify hearing impairment in their children. The signs of conductive hearing loss to look for in a child are that he may:- In little older children, hearing difficulties can be confused with behaviour problems. Constant inattentiveness, below–average school performance and frequent colds and ear aches are also signs that there may be a hearing problem and thus these problems should not be ignored and community workers should help the parents to get their child's hearing tested by a qualified audiologist and/or the child should be seen by an ENT specialist. The Government and/or voluntary oranizations and the community workers should aim at community awareness of early detection of a hearing loss in a child. As the first 3 – 5 yrs. of life are crucial for developing good speech & language skills, an undiagnosed hearing loss may lead to poor speech & language difficulties and sometimes it may even result in behaviour problems. Thus, the earlier hearing loss is recognized, the better it will be for a child's overall development. What is important here for the community workers is to keep in mind the rate at which children normally learn and develop speech & language skills and what should parents expect at various early stages of a child's life The aim should be on amplification needs for a preschool child. If amplification seems likely, it is better that his/her hearing evaluation be done at the earliest and the community workers should provide all the possible support to parents. If help is provided early in the life of a child with hearing loss, the effect of the loss may be reduced greatly. The community workers should motivate and provide help to families of young children to get involved in the early intervention services which are made available at community level and also elsewhere so that the needs of the child are taken care of. Both permanent and temporary type of hearing loss are caused by many different conditions. The sooner a hearing problem is detected, the better it will be for a child's development. The community workers should encourage the active participation of parents and their families in the identification & management of the problems. Community workers should make it a point to get the full cooperation of the parents. If this is maintained, the parents are motivated to participate in training/guidance/counselling provided to them and the outcome will be successful. The extent to which the professionals and/or community workers demonstrate concern and regard for patients and parents and interest in their perception of their own problems is crucial in establishing an effective professional – patient, professional – parent relationship and community workers – patient & community workers – parents relationship. The gainful Occupation or Economic Rehabilitation should be the ultimate aim of a Rehabilitation process at community levels. To whatever extent possible the community workers should take on the responsibility for planning, implementation & monitoring a rehabilitation programme. Community workers should see that various Govt. schemes for the welfare of hearing handicapped are made available to the PWD. An awareness should be created on the schemes available Community participation at all level is an essential part of a rehabilitation programme and the community workers/members should actively participate in : Last Modified : 11/22/2023 This portal has been developed as part of the national level initiative - India Development Gateway (InDG), dedicated for providing information / knowledge and ICT based knowledge products and services in the domain of social development.

For Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) universal accessibility is critical for enabling them to gain access for equal opportunity and live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life in an inclusive society. Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 under Sections 44, 45 and 46 categorically provides for non-discrimination in transport, non-discrimination on the road and non-discrimination in built environment respectively. As per Section 46 of the PwD Act, the States are required to provide for – Section 44 and 45 of the said Act cast responsibility on the States to take measures to make public transport accessible for PwDs and also make provision for auditory signals at red lights in public roads, curb cuts and slops in pavements, engraving on the surface at zebra crossings etc. United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), to which India is a signatory, under Article 9 casts an obligation on all the signatory governments to take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.

The Strategy comprises 10 goals, 27 targets and 62 indicators, which build on UNCRPD.  Goal No. 3 of the Incheon Strategy mentions that access to the physical environment, public transportation, knowledge, information and communication is a precondition for persons with disabilities to fulfill their rights in an inclusive society.  The accessibility of urban, rural and remote areas based on universal design increases safety and ease of use not only for persons with disabilities, but also for all other members of society.  Access audits are an important means of ensuring accessibility and must cover all stages of the process of planning, design, construction, maintenance and monitoring and evaluation.  Access to assistive devices and related support services is also a precondition for persons with disabilities to optimize their level of independence in daily life and live in dignity.  Ensuring the availability of assistive devices for those living in low-resource settings involves encouraging research, development, production, distribution and maintenance. Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) has the following three important components A multi-pronged strategy will be adopted for the campaign with key components as (a) leadership endorsements of the campaign, (b) mass awareness, (c) capacity building through workshops, (d) interventions (legal frame-work, technology solutions, resource generation, etc. and (e) leverage corporate sector efforts in a Public-Private Partnership.

{"content": "An accessible physical environment benefits everyone, not just persons with disabilities. Measures should be undertaken to eliminate obstacles and barriers to indoor and outdoor facilities including schools, medical facilities, and workplaces. These would include not only buildings, but also footpaths, curb cuts, and obstacles that block the flow of pedestrian traffic. An accessible government building is one, where persons with disabilities have no barrier in entering it and using all the facilities therein. This covers the built environment – services, steps and ramps, corridors, entry gates, emergency exits, parking – as well as indoor and outdoor facilities including lighting, signages, alarm systems and toilets. Identifying accessible buildings requires annual accessibility audits that determine if a building meets agreed upon standards. Once a building is deemed fully accessible, an annual audit is not necessary, but should be required for any proposed changes to the structure or systems contained therein. A full audit can then be done on a less frequent basis. Standards of accessibility should be as consistent as possible with international standards, such as those of the ISO, taking into account the local context. In regards to the built environment, ISO 21542:2011, Building Construction – Accessibility and Usability of the Built Environment, delineates a set of requirements and recommendations concerning construction, assembly, components and fittings. Persons with disabilities have an equal right to travel and use public and private transportation infrastructure with dignity and independence. Accessible transportation plays a critical role in the growth of its economy. Inaccessible transportation system restricts mobility, denies freedom of movement and active participation, for much of the population who may need accessible transportation. The revised National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP), 2014 includes universal accessibility in all the planning and implementation interventions. Indian Roads Congress code 103:2012 Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities provides inclusive roads and street design standards. Some of the key features related to transport infrastructure accessibility are as follows: Access to information creates opportunities for everyone in society. Access to information refers to all information. People use information in many forms to make decisions about their daily lives. This can range from actions such as being able to read price tags, to physically enter a hall, to participate in an event, to read a pamphlet with healthcare information, to understand a train timetable, or to view webpages. No longer should societal barriers of infrastructure, and inaccessible formats stand in the way of obtaining and utilizing information in daily life. This target will ensure conversion of public documents published as of a specified year and all current websites meeting the relevant International Organization for Standardization (ISO) criteria, that are found in ISO / IEC 40500 : 2012, Information Technology – W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. Public documents refer to all documents issued by the national government as well as all subnational documents. They include all publications such as laws, regulations, reports, forms and informational brochures. The standard (Part 1) specifies the needs of people with visual, auditory, speech, physical and neurological disabilities and those with limited cognition, language, and learning applicable to ICT products and services in terms of functional performance statements. It then covers the generic technical requirements for various kinds of ICT to meet functional performance statements. In line with the RPwD Act 2016, this standard covers a wide range of ICT products and services relating to information and communication, including telecom services, web-based services, electronic and print services, digital and virtual services. This standard (Part 1) is intended to be used in the context of web based technologies, non-web technologies and those that use both. It covers software, hardware and content as well as services. The conformance criteria on test descriptions and evaluation methodology are covered in Part 2 of this standard. - Last Modified : 9/15/2022 This topic provides information about Inclusivenes...

{"content": "The creation of a distinct government agency for the divyang was approved by the Maharashtra state government (differently abled) during 2022. The same was announced on the occasion of the International Day of Disabled Persons 2022. This comes after 20 years of calls for the creation of a special department to oversee the care and safety of those with disabilities. The first state in India to have a distinct department for Divyang (differently-abled) is Maharashtra. This agency was created to provide professional and educational support to the state's residents who are both physically and mentally challenged. It aims to guarantee the Divyangs' wellbeing and successfully carry out a number of government initiatives aimed at them. A total budget of Rs. 1,143 crores has been allocated for the new department, which has up to 2,063 new positions. Previously, the Social Justice Department, which is overseen by the Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment, had jurisdiction over all grievances and matters relating to people with disabilities. The Social Justice and Special Assistance department's sections that deal with issues affecting individuals with disabilities will all be combined to establish the Divyang department. All programmes put into place for the divyangs will be consolidated under one roof. There are currently about 2.5 crore persons with disabilities living in the state. They will receive assistance from the new department with regard to health, travel, education, employment, scholarships, and rehabilitation. A total of 2,000 specialised trainers for various disabilities are to be hired. In 1992, a resolution proclaiming the International Day of Disabled Persons was approved by the United Nations General Assembly. Every year on December 3, this day is marked to increase public awareness of the problems and difficulties that persons with disabilities encounter. It aims to protect the rights, welfare, and overall dignity of people with disabilities. Last Modified : 11/22/2023 This topic provides information about Raj-Kaushal:...

{"content": "World Braille Day, celebrated on January 04 since 2019, is observed to raise awareness of the importance of Braille as a means of communication in the full realization of the human rights for blind and partially sighted people. World Braille Day was established by the UN General Assembly in December 2018. The date also marks the birth anniversary of Louis Braille, who at the age of 15, invented the tactile system for reading and writing for use by people who are blind or visually impaired. Braille is a tactile representation of alphabetic and numerical symbols using six dots to represent each letter and number, and even musical, mathematical and scientific symbols. Braille is read by passing one’s fingertips over an arrangement of between one to six embossed dots. Braille can be written using a Braillewriter, a device similar to a typewriter, or by using a pointed stylus and a Braille Slate to punch dots on paper. Braille (named after its inventor in 19th century France, Louis Braille) is used by blind and partially sighted people to read the same books and periodicals as those printed in a visual font. Braille is essential in the context of education, freedom of expression and opinion, as well as social inclusion, as reflected in article 2 of the Even under normal circumstances, persons with disabilities - one billion people worldwide - are less likely to access health care, education, employment and to participate in the community. They are more likely to live in poverty, experience higher rates of violence, neglect and abuse, and are among the most marginalized in any crisis-affected community. For the visually impaired, life under lockdown has posed several issues in terms of independence and isolation, especially for people who rely on the use of touch to communicate their needs and access information. The pandemic has revealed how critically important it is to produce essential information in accessible formats, including in Braille and audible formats. Otherwise, many persons with disabilities could face a higher risk of contamination due to a lack of access of guidelines and precautions to protect and reduce the spreading of a pandemic. COVID-19 has also emphasized the need to intensify all activities related to digital accessibility to ensure digital inclusion of all people. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many good practices have been implemented by parts of the United Nations system to promote a disability-inclusive response to the COVID-19 and disseminate information in Braille. In celebration of International Braille Day, the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, in collaboration with multiple National Institutions, Comprehensive Regional Centers (CRCs), and various non-governmental organizations, conducted numerous programmes on January 4. The initiatives aimed to enhance the capabilities of visually impaired and divyangjan individuals, fostering self-reliance.

{"content": "Rehabilitation of hearing impaired persons (children/adults) is a challenge and requires special attention from a team of professionals attached to Govt. and/or Voluntary Organizations and a team of Community Level Workers. The quality of life of persons with disabilities can only be improved when there is a close coordination, collaboration and cooperation between the community members including persons with disabilities, their parents/family members/friends and Govt. and/or voluntary organizations. To meet the rehabilitation needs of persons with disabilities the community effective participation is necessary as the community has a big role to play in the whole process of rehabilitation of persons with disabilities. There could be a number of matters which are required to be looked into at different stages of life of persons with disabilities and thus the focus should be on what is important at a particular stage for persons with disabilities. The parents of children should be provided support and advice to identify hearing impairment in their children. The signs of conductive hearing loss to look for in a child are that he may:- In little older children, hearing difficulties can be confused with behaviour problems. Constant inattentiveness, below–average school performance and frequent colds and ear aches are also signs that there may be a hearing problem and thus these problems should not be ignored and community workers should help the parents to get their child's hearing tested by a qualified audiologist and/or the child should be seen by an ENT specialist. The Government and/or voluntary oranizations and the community workers should aim at community awareness of early detection of a hearing loss in a child. As the first 3 – 5 yrs. of life are crucial for developing good speech & language skills, an undiagnosed hearing loss may lead to poor speech & language difficulties and sometimes it may even result in behaviour problems. Thus, the earlier hearing loss is recognized, the better it will be for a child's overall development. What is important here for the community workers is to keep in mind the rate at which children normally learn and develop speech & language skills and what should parents expect at various early stages of a child's life The aim should be on amplification needs for a preschool child. If amplification seems likely, it is better that his/her hearing evaluation be done at the earliest and the community workers should provide all the possible support to parents. If help is provided early in the life of a child with hearing loss, the effect of the loss may be reduced greatly. The community workers should motivate and provide help to families of young children to get involved in the early intervention services which are made available at community level and also elsewhere so that the needs of the child are taken care of. Both permanent and temporary type of hearing loss are caused by many different conditions. The sooner a hearing problem is detected, the better it will be for a child's development. The community workers should encourage the active participation of parents and their families in the identification & management of the problems. Community workers should make it a point to get the full cooperation of the parents. If this is maintained, the parents are motivated to participate in training/guidance/counselling provided to them and the outcome will be successful. The extent to which the professionals and/or community workers demonstrate concern and regard for patients and parents and interest in their perception of their own problems is crucial in establishing an effective professional – patient, professional – parent relationship and community workers – patient & community workers – parents relationship. The gainful Occupation or Economic Rehabilitation should be the ultimate aim of a Rehabilitation process at community levels. To whatever extent possible the community workers should take on the responsibility for planning, implementation & monitoring a rehabilitation programme. Community workers should see that various Govt. schemes for the welfare of hearing handicapped are made available to the PWD. An awareness should be created on the schemes available Community participation at all level is an essential part of a rehabilitation programme and the community workers/members should actively participate in : Last Modified : 11/22/2023 This portal has been developed as part of the national level initiative - India Development Gateway (InDG), dedicated for providing information / knowledge and ICT based knowledge products and services in the domain of social development.

{"content": "Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD) launched Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) as a nation-wide Campaign for achieving universal accessibility for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) on December 3, 2015. For Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) universal accessibility is critical for enabling them to gain access for equal opportunity and live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life in an inclusive society. Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 under Sections 44, 45 and 46 categorically provides for non-discrimination in transport, non-discrimination on the road and non-discrimination in built environment respectively. As per Section 46 of the PwD Act, the States are required to provide for – Section 44 and 45 of the said Act cast responsibility on the States to take measures to make public transport accessible for PwDs and also make provision for auditory signals at red lights in public roads, curb cuts and slops in pavements, engraving on the surface at zebra crossings etc. United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), to which India is a signatory, under Article 9 casts an obligation on all the signatory governments to take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas. These measures, which shall include the identification and elimination of obstacles and barriers to accessibility, shall apply to, inter-alia : The Convention also mandates that all the Governments shall also take appropriate measures : Governments at the High Level Inter Governmental Meeting organized by the Govt. of Republic of Korea adopted the ministerial declaration and Incheon Strategy to “Make the Right Real” for PwDs in Asia and Pacific.  The Incheon Strategy provides the Asian and Pacific Region, and the world the first set of regionally agreed distinct – inclusive development goals. The Strategy comprises 10 goals, 27 targets and 62 indicators, which build on UNCRPD.  Goal No. 3 of the Incheon Strategy mentions that access to the physical environment, public transportation, knowledge, information and communication is a precondition for persons with disabilities to fulfill their rights in an inclusive society.  The accessibility of urban, rural and remote areas based on universal design increases safety and ease of use not only for persons with disabilities, but also for all other members of society.  Access audits are an important means of ensuring accessibility and must cover all stages of the process of planning, design, construction, maintenance and monitoring and evaluation.  Access to assistive devices and related support services is also a precondition for persons with disabilities to optimize their level of independence in daily life and live in dignity.  Ensuring the availability of assistive devices for those living in low-resource settings involves encouraging research, development, production, distribution and maintenance. Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) has the following three important components A multi-pronged strategy will be adopted for the campaign with key components as (a) leadership endorsements of the campaign, (b) mass awareness, (c) capacity building through workshops, (d) interventions (legal frame-work, technology solutions, resource generation, etc. and (e) leverage corporate sector efforts in a Public-Private Partnership. Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities will sign MOU with State to support spreading awareness about accessibility and help create accessible buildings, accessible transport and accessible websites etc. Under the campaign, - Last Modified : 9/11/2023 This topic provides information about Rights of Pe...

{"content": "The Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAAD) is commemorated every year on the third Thursday of May. The purpose of GAAD is to get everyone talking, thinking and learning about digital (web, software, mobile, etc.) access/inclusion and the more than One Billion people with different disabilities/impairments. Digital accessibility refers to the ability of people with disabilities/impairments to independently consume and/or interact with digital (e.g., web, mobile) applications and content. From both a civil rights and a business perspective, people with disabilities are underserved by today’s digital products. 1 Billion People Worldwide Have Disabilities. Every user deserves a first-rate digital experience on the web. Someone with a disability must be able to experience web-based services, content and other digital products with the same successful outcome as those without disabilities. In 2020, WebAIM analyzed one million home pages for accessibility issues and found the following: The target audience of GAAD is the design, development, usability, and related communities who build, shape, fund and influence technology and its use. While people may be interested in the topic of making technology accessible and usable by persons with disabilities, the reality is that they often do not know how or where to start. Awareness comes first. May 16, 2024, marks the 13th Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD). GAAD organisers encourage designers, developers, usability professionals, and everyone else to take an hour to experience first-hand the impact of digital accessibility (or lack there of). Go ahead and unplug your mouse and only use your keyboard alone (tab/shift tab, arrow keys, enter and spacebar) to navigate and interact with your favorite websites and applications. If you use a touchpad, trackpad or similar input method, disable it, and use the keyboard instead. Developers and designers, we encourage you to visit a site you were involved in creating and take it for a test-drive. There are a number of free/open source screen readers available for Windows users. One of the more popular ones is . Take a bit of time beforehand to download the software and learn some of NVDA’s documented basic keystrokes. Mac users have a built-in screen reader called on their your systems. Take some time to visit the site referenced to familiarize yourself with how to turn on VoiceOver and some of the basic keystrokes. The has a number of built-in accessibility features, as does the . , and devices also have accessibility features. Take an hour to explore what these are and try them out on the Web. In the case of the mobile devices, why not try using some of your favorite apps with different accessibility features enabled.

{"content": "An accessible physical environment benefits everyone, not just persons with disabilities. Measures should be undertaken to eliminate obstacles and barriers to indoor and outdoor facilities including schools, medical facilities, and workplaces. These would include not only buildings, but also footpaths, curb cuts, and obstacles that block the flow of pedestrian traffic. An accessible government building is one, where persons with disabilities have no barrier in entering it and using all the facilities therein. This covers the built environment – services, steps and ramps, corridors, entry gates, emergency exits, parking – as well as indoor and outdoor facilities including lighting, signages, alarm systems and toilets. Identifying accessible buildings requires annual accessibility audits that determine if a building meets agreed upon standards. Once a building is deemed fully accessible, an annual audit is not necessary, but should be required for any proposed changes to the structure or systems contained therein. A full audit can then be done on a less frequent basis. Standards of accessibility should be as consistent as possible with international standards, such as those of the ISO, taking into account the local context. In regards to the built environment, ISO 21542:2011, Building Construction – Accessibility and Usability of the Built Environment, delineates a set of requirements and recommendations concerning construction, assembly, components and fittings. Persons with disabilities have an equal right to travel and use public and private transportation infrastructure with dignity and independence. Accessible transportation plays a critical role in the growth of its economy. Inaccessible transportation system restricts mobility, denies freedom of movement and active participation, for much of the population who may need accessible transportation. The revised National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP), 2014 includes universal accessibility in all the planning and implementation interventions. Indian Roads Congress code 103:2012 Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities provides inclusive roads and street design standards. Some of the key features related to transport infrastructure accessibility are as follows: Access to information creates opportunities for everyone in society. Access to information refers to all information. People use information in many forms to make decisions about their daily lives. This can range from actions such as being able to read price tags, to physically enter a hall, to participate in an event, to read a pamphlet with healthcare information, to understand a train timetable, or to view webpages. No longer should societal barriers of infrastructure, and inaccessible formats stand in the way of obtaining and utilizing information in daily life.

{"content": "An accessible physical environment benefits everyone, not just persons with disabilities. Measures should be undertaken to eliminate obstacles and barriers to indoor and outdoor facilities including schools, medical facilities, and workplaces. These would include not only buildings, but also footpaths, curb cuts, and obstacles that block the flow of pedestrian traffic. An accessible government building is one, where persons with disabilities have no barrier in entering it and using all the facilities therein. This covers the built environment – services, steps and ramps, corridors, entry gates, emergency exits, parking – as well as indoor and outdoor facilities including lighting, signages, alarm systems and toilets. Identifying accessible buildings requires annual accessibility audits that determine if a building meets agreed upon standards. Once a building is deemed fully accessible, an annual audit is not necessary, but should be required for any proposed changes to the structure or systems contained therein. A full audit can then be done on a less frequent basis. Standards of accessibility should be as consistent as possible with international standards, such as those of the ISO, taking into account the local context. In regards to the built environment, ISO 21542:2011, Building Construction – Accessibility and Usability of the Built Environment, delineates a set of requirements and recommendations concerning construction, assembly, components and fittings. Persons with disabilities have an equal right to travel and use public and private transportation infrastructure with dignity and independence. Accessible transportation plays a critical role in the growth of its economy. Inaccessible transportation system restricts mobility, denies freedom of movement and active participation, for much of the population who may need accessible transportation.

{"content": "World Braille Day, celebrated on January 04 since 2019, is observed to raise awareness of the importance of Braille as a means of communication in the full realization of the human rights for blind and partially sighted people. World Braille Day was established by the UN General Assembly in December 2018. The date also marks the birth anniversary of Louis Braille, who at the age of 15, invented the tactile system for reading and writing for use by people who are blind or visually impaired. Braille is a tactile representation of alphabetic and numerical symbols using six dots to represent each letter and number, and even musical, mathematical and scientific symbols. Braille is read by passing one’s fingertips over an arrangement of between one to six embossed dots. Braille can be written using a Braillewriter, a device similar to a typewriter, or by using a pointed stylus and a Braille Slate to punch dots on paper. Braille (named after its inventor in 19th century France, Louis Braille) is used by blind and partially sighted people to read the same books and periodicals as those printed in a visual font. Braille is essential in the context of education, freedom of expression and opinion, as well as social inclusion, as reflected in article 2 of the Even under normal circumstances, persons with disabilities - one billion people worldwide - are less likely to access health care, education, employment and to participate in the community. They are more likely to live in poverty, experience higher rates of violence, neglect and abuse, and are among the most marginalized in any crisis-affected community. For the visually impaired, life under lockdown has posed several issues in terms of independence and isolation, especially for people who rely on the use of touch to communicate their needs and access information. The pandemic has revealed how critically important it is to produce essential information in accessible formats, including in Braille and audible formats. Otherwise, many persons with disabilities could face a higher risk of contamination due to a lack of access of guidelines and precautions to protect and reduce the spreading of a pandemic. COVID-19 has also emphasized the need to intensify all activities related to digital accessibility to ensure digital inclusion of all people. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many good practices have been implemented by parts of the United Nations system to promote a disability-inclusive response to the COVID-19 and disseminate information in Braille. In celebration of International Braille Day, the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, in collaboration with multiple National Institutions, Comprehensive Regional Centers (CRCs), and various non-governmental organizations, conducted numerous programmes on January 4. The initiatives aimed to enhance the capabilities of visually impaired and divyangjan individuals, fostering self-reliance.

{"content": "An accessible physical environment benefits everyone, not just persons with disabilities. Measures should be undertaken to eliminate obstacles and barriers to indoor and outdoor facilities including schools, medical facilities, and workplaces. These would include not only buildings, but also footpaths, curb cuts, and obstacles that block the flow of pedestrian traffic. An accessible government building is one, where persons with disabilities have no barrier in entering it and using all the facilities therein. This covers the built environment – services, steps and ramps, corridors, entry gates, emergency exits, parking – as well as indoor and outdoor facilities including lighting, signages, alarm systems and toilets. Identifying accessible buildings requires annual accessibility audits that determine if a building meets agreed upon standards. Once a building is deemed fully accessible, an annual audit is not necessary, but should be required for any proposed changes to the structure or systems contained therein. A full audit can then be done on a less frequent basis. Standards of accessibility should be as consistent as possible with international standards, such as those of the ISO, taking into account the local context. In regards to the built environment, ISO 21542:2011, Building Construction – Accessibility and Usability of the Built Environment, delineates a set of requirements and recommendations concerning construction, assembly, components and fittings. Persons with disabilities have an equal right to travel and use public and private transportation infrastructure with dignity and independence. Accessible transportation plays a critical role in the growth of its economy. Inaccessible transportation system restricts mobility, denies freedom of movement and active participation, for much of the population who may need accessible transportation. The revised National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP), 2014 includes universal accessibility in all the planning and implementation interventions. Indian Roads Congress code 103:2012 Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities provides inclusive roads and street design standards. Some of the key features related to transport infrastructure accessibility are as follows: Access to information creates opportunities for everyone in society. Access to information refers to all information. People use information in many forms to make decisions about their daily lives. This can range from actions such as being able to read price tags, to physically enter a hall, to participate in an event, to read a pamphlet with healthcare information, to understand a train timetable, or to view webpages. No longer should societal barriers of infrastructure, and inaccessible formats stand in the way of obtaining and utilizing information in daily life. This target will ensure conversion of public documents published as of a specified year and all current websites meeting the relevant International Organization for Standardization (ISO) criteria, that are found in ISO / IEC 40500 : 2012, Information Technology – W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. Public documents refer to all documents issued by the national government as well as all subnational documents. They include all publications such as laws, regulations, reports, forms and informational brochures. The standard (Part 1) specifies the needs of people with visual, auditory, speech, physical and neurological disabilities and those with limited cognition, language, and learning applicable to ICT products and services in terms of functional performance statements. It then covers the generic technical requirements for various kinds of ICT to meet functional performance statements. In line with the RPwD Act 2016, this standard covers a wide range of ICT products and services relating to information and communication, including telecom services, web-based services, electronic and print services, digital and virtual services. This standard (Part 1) is intended to be used in the context of web based technologies, non-web technologies and those that use both. It covers software, hardware and content as well as services.

{"content": "The Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAAD) is commemorated every year on the third Thursday of May. The purpose of GAAD is to get everyone talking, thinking and learning about digital (web, software, mobile, etc.) access/inclusion and the more than One Billion people with different disabilities/impairments. Digital accessibility refers to the ability of people with disabilities/impairments to independently consume and/or interact with digital (e.g., web, mobile) applications and content. From both a civil rights and a business perspective, people with disabilities are underserved by today’s digital products. 1 Billion People Worldwide Have Disabilities. Every user deserves a first-rate digital experience on the web. Someone with a disability must be able to experience web-based services, content and other digital products with the same successful outcome as those without disabilities. In 2020, WebAIM analyzed one million home pages for accessibility issues and found the following: The target audience of GAAD is the design, development, usability, and related communities who build, shape, fund and influence technology and its use. While people may be interested in the topic of making technology accessible and usable by persons with disabilities, the reality is that they often do not know how or where to start. Awareness comes first. May 16, 2024, marks the 13th Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD). GAAD organisers encourage designers, developers, usability professionals, and everyone else to take an hour to experience first-hand the impact of digital accessibility (or lack there of). Go ahead and unplug your mouse and only use your keyboard alone (tab/shift tab, arrow keys, enter and spacebar) to navigate and interact with your favorite websites and applications. If you use a touchpad, trackpad or similar input method, disable it, and use the keyboard instead. Developers and designers, we encourage you to visit a site you were involved in creating and take it for a test-drive.

For Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) universal accessibility is critical for enabling them to gain access for equal opportunity and live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life in an inclusive society. Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 under Sections 44, 45 and 46 categorically provides for non-discrimination in transport, non-discrimination on the road and non-discrimination in built environment respectively. As per Section 46 of the PwD Act, the States are required to provide for – Section 44 and 45 of the said Act cast responsibility on the States to take measures to make public transport accessible for PwDs and also make provision for auditory signals at red lights in public roads, curb cuts and slops in pavements, engraving on the surface at zebra crossings etc. United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), to which India is a signatory, under Article 9 casts an obligation on all the signatory governments to take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.

The Strategy comprises 10 goals, 27 targets and 62 indicators, which build on UNCRPD.  Goal No. 3 of the Incheon Strategy mentions that access to the physical environment, public transportation, knowledge, information and communication is a precondition for persons with disabilities to fulfill their rights in an inclusive society.  The accessibility of urban, rural and remote areas based on universal design increases safety and ease of use not only for persons with disabilities, but also for all other members of society.  Access audits are an important means of ensuring accessibility and must cover all stages of the process of planning, design, construction, maintenance and monitoring and evaluation.  Access to assistive devices and related support services is also a precondition for persons with disabilities to optimize their level of independence in daily life and live in dignity.  Ensuring the availability of assistive devices for those living in low-resource settings involves encouraging research, development, production, distribution and maintenance. Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) has the following three important components A multi-pronged strategy will be adopted for the campaign with key components as (a) leadership endorsements of the campaign, (b) mass awareness, (c) capacity building through workshops, (d) interventions (legal frame-work, technology solutions, resource generation, etc. and (e) leverage corporate sector efforts in a Public-Private Partnership.

{"content": "Rehabilitation of hearing impaired persons (children/adults) is a challenge and requires special attention from a team of professionals attached to Govt. and/or Voluntary Organizations and a team of Community Level Workers. The quality of life of persons with disabilities can only be improved when there is a close coordination, collaboration and cooperation between the community members including persons with disabilities, their parents/family members/friends and Govt. and/or voluntary organizations. To meet the rehabilitation needs of persons with disabilities the community effective participation is necessary as the community has a big role to play in the whole process of rehabilitation of persons with disabilities. There could be a number of matters which are required to be looked into at different stages of life of persons with disabilities and thus the focus should be on what is important at a particular stage for persons with disabilities. The parents of children should be provided support and advice to identify hearing impairment in their children. The signs of conductive hearing loss to look for in a child are that he may:- In little older children, hearing difficulties can be confused with behaviour problems. Constant inattentiveness, below–average school performance and frequent colds and ear aches are also signs that there may be a hearing problem and thus these problems should not be ignored and community workers should help the parents to get their child's hearing tested by a qualified audiologist and/or the child should be seen by an ENT specialist. The Government and/or voluntary oranizations and the community workers should aim at community awareness of early detection of a hearing loss in a child. As the first 3 – 5 yrs. of life are crucial for developing good speech & language skills, an undiagnosed hearing loss may lead to poor speech & language difficulties and sometimes it may even result in behaviour problems. Thus, the earlier hearing loss is recognized, the better it will be for a child's overall development. What is important here for the community workers is to keep in mind the rate at which children normally learn and develop speech & language skills and what should parents expect at various early stages of a child's life The aim should be on amplification needs for a preschool child. If amplification seems likely, it is better that his/her hearing evaluation be done at the earliest and the community workers should provide all the possible support to parents. If help is provided early in the life of a child with hearing loss, the effect of the loss may be reduced greatly. The community workers should motivate and provide help to families of young children to get involved in the early intervention services which are made available at community level and also elsewhere so that the needs of the child are taken care of. Both permanent and temporary type of hearing loss are caused by many different conditions. The sooner a hearing problem is detected, the better it will be for a child's development. The community workers should encourage the active participation of parents and their families in the identification & management of the problems. Community workers should make it a point to get the full cooperation of the parents. If this is maintained, the parents are motivated to participate in training/guidance/counselling provided to them and the outcome will be successful. The extent to which the professionals and/or community workers demonstrate concern and regard for patients and parents and interest in their perception of their own problems is crucial in establishing an effective professional – patient, professional – parent relationship and community workers – patient & community workers – parents relationship. The gainful Occupation or Economic Rehabilitation should be the ultimate aim of a Rehabilitation process at community levels. To whatever extent possible the community workers should take on the responsibility for planning, implementation & monitoring a rehabilitation programme. Community workers should see that various Govt. schemes for the welfare of hearing handicapped are made available to the PWD.

{"content": "The United Nations General Assembly, through its resolution on 18th December 2007, unanimously declared 2 April as World Day to highlight the need to help improve the quality of life of those with autism so they can lead full and meaningful lives as an integral part of society. Autism is a lifelong neurological condition that manifests during early childhood, irrespective of gender, race or socio-economic status. The term Autism Spectrum refers to a range of characteristics. Appropriate support, accommodation and acceptance of this neurological variation allow those on the Spectrum to enjoy equal opportunity, and full and effective participation in society. Autism is mainly characterized by its unique social interactions, non-standard ways of learning, keen interests in specific subjects, inclination to routines, challenges in typical communications and particular ways of processing sensory information. The rate of autism in all regions of the world is high and the lack of understanding has a tremendous impact on the individuals, their families and communities. One in 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder, according to estimates by the UN World Health Organization. Around the world, one per cent of the entire population – possibly two per cent – is on the spectrum. In India, 1 out of 89 children born are said to be living with Autism. The stigmatization and discrimination associated with neurological differences remain substantial obstacles to diagnosis and therapies, an issue that must be addressed by both public policy-makers in developing nations, as well as donor countries. World Autism Awareness Day is a moment to recognize and celebrate the important contributions of autistic people in every country and community. But around the world, they continue to confront barriers to their fundamental rights to education, employment and social inclusion — as called for by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As a matter of fundamental rights, governments must invest in stronger community support systems, inclusive education and training programmes, and accessible and technology-based solutions to enable persons with autism to enjoy the same rights as others. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by world leaders at the United Nations in 2015 provide a blueprint for addressing the major challenges facing the world, including inequality. focuses on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all, as the foundation for improving people’s lives and reducing inequalities. The specific targets for SDG 4 refer to the need to ensure “equal access to all levels of education and vocational training” for persons with disabilities and building and upgrading education facilities that are disability sensitive and that provide “inclusive and effective learning environments for all.” In this respect, the SDGs echo the . Article 24 of the Convention recognizes that persons with disabilities have the right to inclusive, quality education on an equal basis with others and that reasonable accommodation of the individual’s requirements should be provided.

{"content": "On 19 December 2017, the UN General Assembly declared 23 September as International Day of Sign Languages (IDSL). According to the World Federation of the Deaf, there are approximately 72 million deaf people worldwide. More than 80% of them live in developing countries. Collectively, they use more than 300 different sign languages. Sign languages are fully fledged natural languages, structurally distinct from the spoken languages. There is also an international sign language, which is used by deaf people in international meetings and informally when travelling and socializing. It is considered a pidgin form of sign language that is not as complex as natural sign languages and has a limited lexicon. The recognizes and promotes the use of sign languages. It makes clear that sign languages are equal in status to spoken languages and obligates states parties to facilitate the learning of sign language and promote the linguistic identity of the deaf community. The proposal for the Day came from the (WFD), a federation of 135 national associations of deaf people, representing approximately 70 million deaf people’s human rights worldwide. The resolution was sponsored by the Permanent Mission of Antigua and Barbuda to the United Nations, co-sponsored by 97 United Nations Member States and adopted by consensus on 19 December 2017. The choice of 23 September commemorates the date that the WFD was established in 1951. This day marks the birth of an advocacy organisation, which has as one of its main goals, the preservation of sign languages and deaf culture as pre-requisites to the realisation of the human rights of deaf people. The resolution establishing the day acknowledges that early access to sign language and services in sign language, including quality education available in sign language, is vital to the growth and development of the deaf individual and critical to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals. It recognizes the importance of preserving sign languages as part of linguistic and cultural diversity. It also emphasizes the principle of “nothing about us without us” in terms of working with deaf communities. The first International Day of Sign Languages was celebrated on 23 September 2018 as part of the , that took place during on 24-30 September 2018. The International Week of the Deaf was first celebrated in September 1958 and has since evolved into a global movement of deaf unity and concerted advocacy to raise awareness of the issues deaf people face in their everyday lives. The UN General Assembly has proclaimed 23 September as the International Day of Sign Languages in order to raise awareness of the importance of sign language in the full realization of the human rights of people who are deaf. The theme for 2024 International Day of Sign languages is As we approach the 20th anniversary of the , adopted in December 2006, let us strive towards a better implementation of the CRPD at the national level through the linguistic human rights of deaf people. The world will highlight the unity generated by sign languages. Deaf communities, governments and civil society organisations continue their collective efforts - hand in hand - to foster, promote and recognise national sign languages as part of their countries’ vibrant and diverse linguistic landscapes. According to the World Federation of the Deaf, there are more than 70 million deaf people worldwide. More than 80% of them live in developing countries. Collectively, they use more than 300 different sign languages. Sign languages are fully fledged natural languages, structurally distinct from the spoken languages. There is also an international sign language, which is used by deaf people in international meetings and informally when travelling and socializing. It is considered a pidgin form of sign language that is not as complex as natural sign languages and has a limited lexicon. The national sign languages as the key to the inclusion of deaf people in society. National sign languages are full, complex natural languages with the same linguistic properties as spoken languages, including phonetic, phonemic, syllabic, morphological, syntactic, discourse,and pragmatic levels of organisation. They are the mother tongue and the natural languages of deaf children. They are the vector of the inclusion of deaf children both in deaf communities and in society, fostering the building of their own identities and communities. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes and promotes the use of sign languages. It makes clear that sign languages are equal in status to spoken languages and obligates states parties to facilitate the learning of sign language and promote the linguistic identity of the deaf community.

{"content": "Every year December 3 is observed as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. The annual observance of the International Day of Disabled Persons on December 3 was proclaimed in 1992, by the United Nations General Assembly resolution 47/3. The observance of the Day aims to promote an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights and well-being of persons with disabilities. It also seeks to increase awareness of gains to be derived from the integration of persons with disabilities in every aspect of political, social, economic and cultural life. The theme of the 2023 International Day of Persons with Disabilities is: \"United in action to rescue and achieve the SDGs for, with and by persons with disabilities\". Given the multiple crises of today’s world, achievement of the SDGs is in peril. At the mid-point of the implementation period for the 2030 Agenda, the world is not on track to reach numerous SDGs targets by 2030. For many, progress has either stalled or regressed below the 2015 baseline. Unfortunately, the world’s poorest and most vulnerable are often the hardest hit in times of crisis. Preliminary findings from the forthcoming UN Disability and Development Report 2023 indicate that the world is even more off track in meeting several SDGs for persons with disabilities. Our efforts to rescue the SDGs for, with and by persons with disabilities need to be intensified and accelerated, given that persons with disabilities have historically been marginalized and have often been among those left furthest behind. A fundamental shift in commitment, solidarity, financing and action is critical. Integral to this is the inclusion of the voices, needs and priorities of the global community of persons with disabilities in all their diversity. Encouragingly, with the adoption of the Political Declaration of the recent SDG Summit, world leaders have recommitted themselves to achieving sustainable development and shared prosperity for all, by focusing on policies and actions that target the poorest and most vulnerable, including persons with disabilities. Building on many decades of UN’s work in the field of disability, the , adopted in 2006, has further advanced the rights and well-being of persons with disabilities in the implementation of the and other international development frameworks, such as the , the , the , and the . A disability is a condition or function judged to be significantly impaired relative to the usual standard of an individual of their group. The term is often used to refer to individual functioning, including physical impairment, sensory impairment, cognitive impairment, intellectual impairment, mental illness, and various types of chronic disease. This usage has been described by some disabled people as being associated with a medical model of disability. Persons with disabilities, “the world’s largest minority”, have generally poorer health, lower education achievements, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty than people without disabilities. This is largely due to the lack of services available to them (like information and communications technology (ICT), justice or transportation) and the many obstacles they face in their everyday lives. These obstacles can take a variety of forms, including those relating to the physical environment, or those resulting from legislation or policy, or from societal attitudes or discrimination. On the occasion of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities i.e. 3rd December, the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment confers National Awards on Individuals, Institutions, Organizations, State/District etc for their outstanding achievements and work done towards empowerment of Persons with Disabilities every year.

It calls for programme for prevention of diseases, which result in disability and the creation of awareness regarding measures to be taken for prevention of disabilities during the period of pregnancy and thereafter to be intensified and their coverage expanded. - Rehabilitation measures can be classified into three distinct groups: Physical rehabilitation, which includes early detection and intervention, counseling & medical interventions and provision of aids & appliances. It will also include the development of rehabilitation professionals. Educational rehabilitation including vocational education and Economic rehabilitation for a dignified life in society. Women with disabilities require protection against exploitation and abuse. Special programmes will be developed for education, employment and providing of other rehabilitation services to women with disabilities keeping in view their special needs. Special educational and vocation training facilities will be setup. Programmes will be undertaken to rehabilitate abandoned disabled women/ girls by encouraging their adoption in families, support to house them and impart them training for gainful employment skills. The Government will encourage the projects where representation of women with disabilities is ensured at least to the extent of twenty five percent of total beneficiaries. - Children with disabilities are the most vulnerable group and need special attention. The Government would strive to: - Ensure right to care, protection and security for children with disabilities; Ensure the right to development with dignity and equality creating an enabling environment where children can exercise their rights, enjoy equal opportunities and full participation in accordance with various statutes. Ensure inclusion and effective access to education, health, vocational training along with specialized rehabilitation services to children with disabilities. Ensure the right to development as well as recognition of special needs and of care, and protection of children with severe disabilities. - Barrier-free environment enables people with disabilities to move about safely and freely, and use the facilities within the built environment. The goal of barrier free design is to provide an environment that supports the independent functioning of individuals so that they can participate without assistance, in every day activities. Therefore, to the maximum extent possible, buildings / places / transportation systems for public use will be made barrier free. - The Government of India has notified guidelines for evaluation of the disabilities and procedure for certification. The Government will ensure that the persons with disabilities obtain the disability certificates without any difficulty in the shortest possible time by adoption of simple, transparent and client-friendly procedures. - Disabled persons, their families and care givers incur substantial additional expenditure for facilitating activities of daily living, medical care, transportation, assistive devices, etc. Therefore, there is a need to provide them social security by various means. Central Government has been providing tax relief to persons with disabilities and their guardians. The State Governments / U.T. Administrations have been providing unemployment allowance or disability pension. The State Governments will be encouraged to develop a comprehensive social security policy for persons with disabilities. The National Policy recognizes the NGO sector as a very important institutional mechanism to provide affordable services to complement the endeavors of the Government. The NGO sector is a vibrant and growing one. It has played a significant role in the provisions of services for persons with disabilities. Some of the NGOs are also undertaking human resource development and research activities. Government has also been actively involving them in policy formulation, planning, implementation, monitoring and has been seeking their advice on various issues relating to persons with disabilities. Interaction with NGOs will be enhanced on various disability issues regarding planning, policy formulation and implementation. Networking, exchange of information and sharing of good practices amongst NGOs will be encouraged and facilitated. Steps will be taken to encourage and accord preference to NGOs working in the underserved and inaccessible areas. Reputed NGOs shall also be encouraged to take up projects in such areas. - There is a need for regular collection, compilation and analysis of data relating to socio-economic conditions of persons with disabilities. The National Sample Survey Organization has been collecting information on Socio-economic conditions of persons with disabilities on regular basis once in ten years since 1981. The Census has also started collection of information on persons with disabilities from the Census-2001. The National Sample Survey Organization will have to collect the information on persons with disabilities at least once in five years. The differences in the definitions adopted by the two agencies will be reconciled. - For improving the quality of life of persons with disabilities, research will be supported on their socio-economic and cultural context, cause of disabilities, early childhood education methodologies, development of user-friendly aids and appliances and all matters connected with disabilities which will significantly alter the quality of their life and civil society's ability to respond to their concerns. Wherever persons with disabilities are subjected to research interventions, their or their family member or caregiver's consent is mandatory. - The contribution of sports for its therapeutic and community spirit is undeniable. Persons with disabilities have right to access sports, recreation and cultural facilities. The Government will take necessary steps to provide them opportunity for participation in various sports, recreation and cultural activities. The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment will be the nodal Ministry to coordinate all matters relating to the implementation of the Policy. An inter-ministerial body to coordinate matters relating to implementation of National Policy will be formed. All stakeholders including prominent NGOs, Disabled Peoples Organizations, advocacy groups and family associations of parents / guardians, experts and professionals will also be represented on this body. Similar arrangements will be encouraged at the State and Districts levels. Panchayati Raj Institutions and Urban Local Bodies will be associated in the functioning of the District Disability Rehabilitation Centres' District Level Committees to coordinate the matters relating to the implementation of the policy. The Ministries of Home Affairs, Health & Family Welfare, Rural Development, Urban Development, Youth Affairs & Sports, Railways, Science & Technology, Statistics & Programme Implementation, Labour, Panchayati Raj and Departments of Elementary Education & Literacy, Secondary & Higher Education, Road Transport & Highways, Public Enterprises, Revenue, Women & , Information Technology and Personnel & Training will setup necessary mechanism for implementation of the policy. A five-year perspective Plan and annual plans setting targets and financial allocations will be prepared by each Ministry / Department. The annual report of these Ministries / Departments will indicate progress achieved during the year. The Chief Commissioner for Disabilities at Central level and State Commissioners at the State level shall play key role in implementation of National Policy, apart from their statutory responsibilities. Panchayati Raj Institutions will play a crucial role in the implementation of the National Policy to address local level issues and draw up suitable programmes, which will be integrated with the district and State plans. These institutions will include disability related components in their projects. Infrastructure created during the course of implementation will be required to be maintained and effectively used for a long period. The community should take a leading role in generating resources with in themselves or through mobilization from private sector organizations to maintain the infrastructure and also to meet the running cost. This step will not only reduce the burden on state resources but will also create a greater sense of responsibility among the community and private entrepreneurs. Every five years a comprehensive review will be done on the implementation of the National Policy. A document indicating status of implementation and a roadmap for five years shall be prepared based on the deliberations in a national level convention. State Governments and Union Territory administrations will be urged to take steps for drawing up State Policy and develop action plan. 26 September 2024 . © 2024 C-DAC. All rights reserved."}

{"content": "The Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) has issued guidelines for conducting written examination for persons with benchmark disabilities (i.e. with 40% or more disability, for whom the benefit of reservation in Government posts are allowed) on 29.08.2018 and corrigendum dated 08.02.2019 which inter-alia, provides for grant of scribe and compensatory time. Hon'ble Supreme Court in its order dated 11.02.2021 in the matter of Shri Vikash Kumar Vs UPSC and others has directed the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) to frame proper guidelines which would regulate and facilitate the grant of a facility of a scribe to persons with disability within the meaning of Section 2 (s) of the RPwD Act, 2016, where the nature of disability operates to impose a barrier to the candidate writing an examination. These guidelines should also prescribe appropriate norms to ensure that condition of the candidate is duly certified by such competent medical authority as may be prescribed so as to ensure that only genuine candidates in need of the facility are able to avail it. Keeping in view the above order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, an Expert Committee was constituted to consider the issue and suggest guidelines accordingly. The Committee noted that there are various types of clinical problems that can affect the writing capacity. After careful consideration of the matter, the Committee recommended that sole criteria for grant of scribe and compensatory time should be based on assessment of the capability of a person to write. The Committee accordingly recommended the following guidelines for conducting written examination for persons with specified disabilities covered under the definition of Section 2(s) of the RPwD Act,2016 but not covered under the definition of Section 2(r) of the said Act, i.e. persons having less than 40% disability and having difficulty in writing. The facility of scribe and/or compensatory time shall be granted solely to those having difficulty in writing subject to production of a certificate to the effect that person concerned has limitation to write and that scribe is essential to write examination on his/her behalf from the competent medical authority of a Government healthcare institution as per proforma at . The medical authority for the purpose of certification as mentioned in point above should be a multi-member authority comprising the following:- (* the Chief Medical Officer/Civil Surgeon/Chief District Medical Officer may make full efforts for inclusion of neurologists, occupational therapist from the nearest District or the Medical College/Institute, if the same is not available in the District)\" The candidate should have the discretion of opting for his own scribe or request the Examination Body for the same. The examination body may also identify the scribe to make panels at the District/Division/State level as per the requirements of the examination. In later instances the candidates should be allowed to meet the scribe two days before the examination so that the candidates get a chance to check and verify whether the scribe is suitable or not. In case the examination body provides the scribe, it shall be ensured that qualification of the scribe should not be more than the minimum qualification criteria of the examination. However, the qualification of the scribe should always be matriculate or above. In case the candidate is allowed to bring his own scribe, the qualification of the scribe should be one step below the qualification of the candidate taking examination. The person opting for own scribe should submit details of the own scribe as per proforma at . There should also be flexibility in accommodating any change in scribe in case of emergency. The candidates should also be allowed to take different scribe for writing different papers especially for languages. However, there can be only one scribe per subject. The candidate should be allowed to use aids and assistive devices such as prosthetics & orthotics, hearing aid as mentioned related to the certificate issued by medical authority as per Appendix I. Compensatory time not less than 20 minutes per hour of the examination should be allowed for persons who are eligible for getting scribe. In case the duration of the 3 examination is less than an hour, then the duration of the compensatory time should be allowed on pro-rata basis. Compensatory time should not be less than 5 minutes and should be in the multiple of 5. The examination bodies shall modify their application forms to incorporate specific needs of this category of persons. In case, any incident has been reported after filling up the form, the examination bodies shall inform the candidates to obtain medical certificate as per these guidelines for facilitating grant of scribe and/or compensatory time. As far as possible the examination for such persons may be held at ground floor. The examination centres should be accessible for persons with disabilities.

{"content": "The United Nations General Assembly, through its resolution on 18th December 2007, unanimously declared 2 April as World Day to highlight the need to help improve the quality of life of those with autism so they can lead full and meaningful lives as an integral part of society. Autism is a lifelong neurological condition that manifests during early childhood, irrespective of gender, race or socio-economic status. The term Autism Spectrum refers to a range of characteristics. Appropriate support, accommodation and acceptance of this neurological variation allow those on the Spectrum to enjoy equal opportunity, and full and effective participation in society. Autism is mainly characterized by its unique social interactions, non-standard ways of learning, keen interests in specific subjects, inclination to routines, challenges in typical communications and particular ways of processing sensory information. The rate of autism in all regions of the world is high and the lack of understanding has a tremendous impact on the individuals, their families and communities. One in 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder, according to estimates by the UN World Health Organization. Around the world, one per cent of the entire population – possibly two per cent – is on the spectrum. In India, 1 out of 89 children born are said to be living with Autism. The stigmatization and discrimination associated with neurological differences remain substantial obstacles to diagnosis and therapies, an issue that must be addressed by both public policy-makers in developing nations, as well as donor countries. World Autism Awareness Day is a moment to recognize and celebrate the important contributions of autistic people in every country and community. But around the world, they continue to confront barriers to their fundamental rights to education, employment and social inclusion — as called for by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As a matter of fundamental rights, governments must invest in stronger community support systems, inclusive education and training programmes, and accessible and technology-based solutions to enable persons with autism to enjoy the same rights as others. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by world leaders at the United Nations in 2015 provide a blueprint for addressing the major challenges facing the world, including inequality. focuses on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all, as the foundation for improving people’s lives and reducing inequalities. The specific targets for SDG 4 refer to the need to ensure “equal access to all levels of education and vocational training” for persons with disabilities and building and upgrading education facilities that are disability sensitive and that provide “inclusive and effective learning environments for all.” In this respect, the SDGs echo the . Article 24 of the Convention recognizes that persons with disabilities have the right to inclusive, quality education on an equal basis with others and that reasonable accommodation of the individual’s requirements should be provided.

{"content": "On 19 December 2017, the UN General Assembly declared 23 September as International Day of Sign Languages (IDSL). According to the World Federation of the Deaf, there are approximately 72 million deaf people worldwide. More than 80% of them live in developing countries. Collectively, they use more than 300 different sign languages. Sign languages are fully fledged natural languages, structurally distinct from the spoken languages. There is also an international sign language, which is used by deaf people in international meetings and informally when travelling and socializing. It is considered a pidgin form of sign language that is not as complex as natural sign languages and has a limited lexicon. The recognizes and promotes the use of sign languages. It makes clear that sign languages are equal in status to spoken languages and obligates states parties to facilitate the learning of sign language and promote the linguistic identity of the deaf community. The proposal for the Day came from the (WFD), a federation of 135 national associations of deaf people, representing approximately 70 million deaf people’s human rights worldwide. The resolution was sponsored by the Permanent Mission of Antigua and Barbuda to the United Nations, co-sponsored by 97 United Nations Member States and adopted by consensus on 19 December 2017. The choice of 23 September commemorates the date that the WFD was established in 1951. This day marks the birth of an advocacy organisation, which has as one of its main goals, the preservation of sign languages and deaf culture as pre-requisites to the realisation of the human rights of deaf people. The resolution establishing the day acknowledges that early access to sign language and services in sign language, including quality education available in sign language, is vital to the growth and development of the deaf individual and critical to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals. It recognizes the importance of preserving sign languages as part of linguistic and cultural diversity. It also emphasizes the principle of “nothing about us without us” in terms of working with deaf communities. The first International Day of Sign Languages was celebrated on 23 September 2018 as part of the , that took place during on 24-30 September 2018. The International Week of the Deaf was first celebrated in September 1958 and has since evolved into a global movement of deaf unity and concerted advocacy to raise awareness of the issues deaf people face in their everyday lives. The UN General Assembly has proclaimed 23 September as the International Day of Sign Languages in order to raise awareness of the importance of sign language in the full realization of the human rights of people who are deaf. The theme for 2024 International Day of Sign languages is As we approach the 20th anniversary of the , adopted in December 2006, let us strive towards a better implementation of the CRPD at the national level through the linguistic human rights of deaf people. The world will highlight the unity generated by sign languages. Deaf communities, governments and civil society organisations continue their collective efforts - hand in hand - to foster, promote and recognise national sign languages as part of their countries’ vibrant and diverse linguistic landscapes. According to the World Federation of the Deaf, there are more than 70 million deaf people worldwide. More than 80% of them live in developing countries. Collectively, they use more than 300 different sign languages. Sign languages are fully fledged natural languages, structurally distinct from the spoken languages. There is also an international sign language, which is used by deaf people in international meetings and informally when travelling and socializing. It is considered a pidgin form of sign language that is not as complex as natural sign languages and has a limited lexicon. The national sign languages as the key to the inclusion of deaf people in society. National sign languages are full, complex natural languages with the same linguistic properties as spoken languages, including phonetic, phonemic, syllabic, morphological, syntactic, discourse,and pragmatic levels of organisation. They are the mother tongue and the natural languages of deaf children. They are the vector of the inclusion of deaf children both in deaf communities and in society, fostering the building of their own identities and communities.

{"content": "Every year December 3 is observed as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. The annual observance of the International Day of Disabled Persons on December 3 was proclaimed in 1992, by the United Nations General Assembly resolution 47/3. The observance of the Day aims to promote an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights and well-being of persons with disabilities. It also seeks to increase awareness of gains to be derived from the integration of persons with disabilities in every aspect of political, social, economic and cultural life. The theme of the 2023 International Day of Persons with Disabilities is: \"United in action to rescue and achieve the SDGs for, with and by persons with disabilities\". Given the multiple crises of today’s world, achievement of the SDGs is in peril. At the mid-point of the implementation period for the 2030 Agenda, the world is not on track to reach numerous SDGs targets by 2030. For many, progress has either stalled or regressed below the 2015 baseline. Unfortunately, the world’s poorest and most vulnerable are often the hardest hit in times of crisis. Preliminary findings from the forthcoming UN Disability and Development Report 2023 indicate that the world is even more off track in meeting several SDGs for persons with disabilities. Our efforts to rescue the SDGs for, with and by persons with disabilities need to be intensified and accelerated, given that persons with disabilities have historically been marginalized and have often been among those left furthest behind. A fundamental shift in commitment, solidarity, financing and action is critical. Integral to this is the inclusion of the voices, needs and priorities of the global community of persons with disabilities in all their diversity. Encouragingly, with the adoption of the Political Declaration of the recent SDG Summit, world leaders have recommitted themselves to achieving sustainable development and shared prosperity for all, by focusing on policies and actions that target the poorest and most vulnerable, including persons with disabilities. Building on many decades of UN’s work in the field of disability, the , adopted in 2006, has further advanced the rights and well-being of persons with disabilities in the implementation of the and other international development frameworks, such as the , the , the , and the . A disability is a condition or function judged to be significantly impaired relative to the usual standard of an individual of their group. The term is often used to refer to individual functioning, including physical impairment, sensory impairment, cognitive impairment, intellectual impairment, mental illness, and various types of chronic disease. This usage has been described by some disabled people as being associated with a medical model of disability. Persons with disabilities, “the world’s largest minority”, have generally poorer health, lower education achievements, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty than people without disabilities. This is largely due to the lack of services available to them (like information and communications technology (ICT), justice or transportation) and the many obstacles they face in their everyday lives. These obstacles can take a variety of forms, including those relating to the physical environment, or those resulting from legislation or policy, or from societal attitudes or discrimination. On the occasion of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities i.e. 3rd December, the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment confers National Awards on Individuals, Institutions, Organizations, State/District etc for their outstanding achievements and work done towards empowerment of Persons with Disabilities every year.

{"content": "Every year December 3 is observed as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. The annual observance of the International Day of Disabled Persons on December 3 was proclaimed in 1992, by the United Nations General Assembly resolution 47/3. The observance of the Day aims to promote an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights and well-being of persons with disabilities. It also seeks to increase awareness of gains to be derived from the integration of persons with disabilities in every aspect of political, social, economic and cultural life. The theme of the 2023 International Day of Persons with Disabilities is: \"United in action to rescue and achieve the SDGs for, with and by persons with disabilities\". Given the multiple crises of today’s world, achievement of the SDGs is in peril. At the mid-point of the implementation period for the 2030 Agenda, the world is not on track to reach numerous SDGs targets by 2030. For many, progress has either stalled or regressed below the 2015 baseline. Unfortunately, the world’s poorest and most vulnerable are often the hardest hit in times of crisis. Preliminary findings from the forthcoming UN Disability and Development Report 2023 indicate that the world is even more off track in meeting several SDGs for persons with disabilities. Our efforts to rescue the SDGs for, with and by persons with disabilities need to be intensified and accelerated, given that persons with disabilities have historically been marginalized and have often been among those left furthest behind. A fundamental shift in commitment, solidarity, financing and action is critical. Integral to this is the inclusion of the voices, needs and priorities of the global community of persons with disabilities in all their diversity. Encouragingly, with the adoption of the Political Declaration of the recent SDG Summit, world leaders have recommitted themselves to achieving sustainable development and shared prosperity for all, by focusing on policies and actions that target the poorest and most vulnerable, including persons with disabilities. Building on many decades of UN’s work in the field of disability, the , adopted in 2006, has further advanced the rights and well-being of persons with disabilities in the implementation of the and other international development frameworks, such as the , the , the , and the . A disability is a condition or function judged to be significantly impaired relative to the usual standard of an individual of their group. The term is often used to refer to individual functioning, including physical impairment, sensory impairment, cognitive impairment, intellectual impairment, mental illness, and various types of chronic disease. This usage has been described by some disabled people as being associated with a medical model of disability. Persons with disabilities, “the world’s largest minority”, have generally poorer health, lower education achievements, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty than people without disabilities. This is largely due to the lack of services available to them (like information and communications technology (ICT), justice or transportation) and the many obstacles they face in their everyday lives. These obstacles can take a variety of forms, including those relating to the physical environment, or those resulting from legislation or policy, or from societal attitudes or discrimination. On the occasion of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities i.e. 3rd December, the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment confers National Awards on Individuals, Institutions, Organizations, State/District etc for their outstanding achievements and work done towards empowerment of Persons with Disabilities every year.

It calls for programme for prevention of diseases, which result in disability and the creation of awareness regarding measures to be taken for prevention of disabilities during the period of pregnancy and thereafter to be intensified and their coverage expanded. - Rehabilitation measures can be classified into three distinct groups: Physical rehabilitation, which includes early detection and intervention, counseling & medical interventions and provision of aids & appliances. It will also include the development of rehabilitation professionals. Educational rehabilitation including vocational education and Economic rehabilitation for a dignified life in society. Women with disabilities require protection against exploitation and abuse. Special programmes will be developed for education, employment and providing of other rehabilitation services to women with disabilities keeping in view their special needs. Special educational and vocation training facilities will be setup. Programmes will be undertaken to rehabilitate abandoned disabled women/ girls by encouraging their adoption in families, support to house them and impart them training for gainful employment skills. The Government will encourage the projects where representation of women with disabilities is ensured at least to the extent of twenty five percent of total beneficiaries. - Children with disabilities are the most vulnerable group and need special attention. The Government would strive to: - Ensure right to care, protection and security for children with disabilities; Ensure the right to development with dignity and equality creating an enabling environment where children can exercise their rights, enjoy equal opportunities and full participation in accordance with various statutes. Ensure inclusion and effective access to education, health, vocational training along with specialized rehabilitation services to children with disabilities.

The goal of barrier free design is to provide an environment that supports the independent functioning of individuals so that they can participate without assistance, in every day activities. Therefore, to the maximum extent possible, buildings / places / transportation systems for public use will be made barrier free. - The Government of India has notified guidelines for evaluation of the disabilities and procedure for certification. The Government will ensure that the persons with disabilities obtain the disability certificates without any difficulty in the shortest possible time by adoption of simple, transparent and client-friendly procedures. - Disabled persons, their families and care givers incur substantial additional expenditure for facilitating activities of daily living, medical care, transportation, assistive devices, etc. Therefore, there is a need to provide them social security by various means. Central Government has been providing tax relief to persons with disabilities and their guardians. The State Governments / U.T. Administrations have been providing unemployment allowance or disability pension. The State Governments will be encouraged to develop a comprehensive social security policy for persons with disabilities. The National Policy recognizes the NGO sector as a very important institutional mechanism to provide affordable services to complement the endeavors of the Government. The NGO sector is a vibrant and growing one. It has played a significant role in the provisions of services for persons with disabilities. Some of the NGOs are also undertaking human resource development and research activities. Government has also been actively involving them in policy formulation, planning, implementation, monitoring and has been seeking their advice on various issues relating to persons with disabilities. Interaction with NGOs will be enhanced on various disability issues regarding planning, policy formulation and implementation. Networking, exchange of information and sharing of good practices amongst NGOs will be encouraged and facilitated. Steps will be taken to encourage and accord preference to NGOs working in the underserved and inaccessible areas. Reputed NGOs shall also be encouraged to take up projects in such areas. - There is a need for regular collection, compilation and analysis of data relating to socio-economic conditions of persons with disabilities. The National Sample Survey Organization has been collecting information on Socio-economic conditions of persons with disabilities on regular basis once in ten years since 1981. The Census has also started collection of information on persons with disabilities from the Census-2001. The National Sample Survey Organization will have to collect the information on persons with disabilities at least once in five years. The differences in the definitions adopted by the two agencies will be reconciled. - For improving the quality of life of persons with disabilities, research will be supported on their socio-economic and cultural context, cause of disabilities, early childhood education methodologies, development of user-friendly aids and appliances and all matters connected with disabilities which will significantly alter the quality of their life and civil society's ability to respond to their concerns. Wherever persons with disabilities are subjected to research interventions, their or their family member or caregiver's consent is mandatory. - The contribution of sports for its therapeutic and community spirit is undeniable. Persons with disabilities have right to access sports, recreation and cultural facilities. The Government will take necessary steps to provide them opportunity for participation in various sports, recreation and cultural activities. The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment will be the nodal Ministry to coordinate all matters relating to the implementation of the Policy. An inter-ministerial body to coordinate matters relating to implementation of National Policy will be formed. All stakeholders including prominent NGOs, Disabled Peoples Organizations, advocacy groups and family associations of parents / guardians, experts and professionals will also be represented on this body. Similar arrangements will be encouraged at the State and Districts levels. Panchayati Raj Institutions and Urban Local Bodies will be associated in the functioning of the District Disability Rehabilitation Centres' District Level Committees to coordinate the matters relating to the implementation of the policy. The Ministries of Home Affairs, Health & Family Welfare, Rural Development, Urban Development, Youth Affairs & Sports, Railways, Science & Technology, Statistics & Programme Implementation, Labour, Panchayati Raj and Departments of Elementary Education & Literacy, Secondary & Higher Education, Road Transport & Highways, Public Enterprises, Revenue, Women & , Information Technology and Personnel & Training will setup necessary mechanism for implementation of the policy. A five-year perspective Plan and annual plans setting targets and financial allocations will be prepared by each Ministry / Department. The annual report of these Ministries / Departments will indicate progress achieved during the year. The Chief Commissioner for Disabilities at Central level and State Commissioners at the State level shall play key role in implementation of National Policy, apart from their statutory responsibilities. Panchayati Raj Institutions will play a crucial role in the implementation of the National Policy to address local level issues and draw up suitable programmes, which will be integrated with the district and State plans. These institutions will include disability related components in their projects. Infrastructure created during the course of implementation will be required to be maintained and effectively used for a long period. The community should take a leading role in generating resources with in themselves or through mobilization from private sector organizations to maintain the infrastructure and also to meet the running cost. This step will not only reduce the burden on state resources but will also create a greater sense of responsibility among the community and private entrepreneurs. Every five years a comprehensive review will be done on the implementation of the National Policy. A document indicating status of implementation and a roadmap for five years shall be prepared based on the deliberations in a national level convention. State Governments and Union Territory administrations will be urged to take steps for drawing up State Policy and develop action plan. 26 September 2024 . © 2024 C-DAC. All rights reserved."}

{"content": "The Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) has issued guidelines for conducting written examination for persons with benchmark disabilities (i.e. with 40% or more disability, for whom the benefit of reservation in Government posts are allowed) on 29.08.2018 and corrigendum dated 08.02.2019 which inter-alia, provides for grant of scribe and compensatory time. Hon'ble Supreme Court in its order dated 11.02.2021 in the matter of Shri Vikash Kumar Vs UPSC and others has directed the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) to frame proper guidelines which would regulate and facilitate the grant of a facility of a scribe to persons with disability within the meaning of Section 2 (s) of the RPwD Act, 2016, where the nature of disability operates to impose a barrier to the candidate writing an examination. These guidelines should also prescribe appropriate norms to ensure that condition of the candidate is duly certified by such competent medical authority as may be prescribed so as to ensure that only genuine candidates in need of the facility are able to avail it. Keeping in view the above order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, an Expert Committee was constituted to consider the issue and suggest guidelines accordingly. The Committee noted that there are various types of clinical problems that can affect the writing capacity. After careful consideration of the matter, the Committee recommended that sole criteria for grant of scribe and compensatory time should be based on assessment of the capability of a person to write. The Committee accordingly recommended the following guidelines for conducting written examination for persons with specified disabilities covered under the definition of Section 2(s) of the RPwD Act,2016 but not covered under the definition of Section 2(r) of the said Act, i.e. persons having less than 40% disability and having difficulty in writing. The facility of scribe and/or compensatory time shall be granted solely to those having difficulty in writing subject to production of a certificate to the effect that person concerned has limitation to write and that scribe is essential to write examination on his/her behalf from the competent medical authority of a Government healthcare institution as per proforma at . The medical authority for the purpose of certification as mentioned in point above should be a multi-member authority comprising the following:- (* the Chief Medical Officer/Civil Surgeon/Chief District Medical Officer may make full efforts for inclusion of neurologists, occupational therapist from the nearest District or the Medical College/Institute, if the same is not available in the District)\" The candidate should have the discretion of opting for his own scribe or request the Examination Body for the same. The examination body may also identify the scribe to make panels at the District/Division/State level as per the requirements of the examination. In later instances the candidates should be allowed to meet the scribe two days before the examination so that the candidates get a chance to check and verify whether the scribe is suitable or not. In case the examination body provides the scribe, it shall be ensured that qualification of the scribe should not be more than the minimum qualification criteria of the examination. However, the qualification of the scribe should always be matriculate or above. In case the candidate is allowed to bring his own scribe, the qualification of the scribe should be one step below the qualification of the candidate taking examination. The person opting for own scribe should submit details of the own scribe as per proforma at . There should also be flexibility in accommodating any change in scribe in case of emergency. The candidates should also be allowed to take different scribe for writing different papers especially for languages. However, there can be only one scribe per subject. The candidate should be allowed to use aids and assistive devices such as prosthetics & orthotics, hearing aid as mentioned related to the certificate issued by medical authority as per Appendix I. Compensatory time not less than 20 minutes per hour of the examination should be allowed for persons who are eligible for getting scribe. In case the duration of the 3 examination is less than an hour, then the duration of the compensatory time should be allowed on pro-rata basis. Compensatory time should not be less than 5 minutes and should be in the multiple of 5. The examination bodies shall modify their application forms to incorporate specific needs of this category of persons. In case, any incident has been reported after filling up the form, the examination bodies shall inform the candidates to obtain medical certificate as per these guidelines for facilitating grant of scribe and/or compensatory time. As far as possible the examination for such persons may be held at ground floor. The examination centres should be accessible for persons with disabilities. (k) These guidelines are applicable to written examinations conducted by central recruitment agencies as well as academic institutions. The States/UTs may adopt these guidelines or issue similar guidelines to maintain uniformity. These guidelines are independent of the Guidelines for conducting written examination for persons with benchmark disabilities issued by the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities on 29.08.2018. The examining bodies shall ensure strict vigilance to check misuse of facility of scribe. All the recruitment agencies, Academics/Examination Bodies etc. under the administrative control of each Ministry/Department may be advised appropriately to ensure compliance of implementing these guidelines.

{"content": "The Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) has issued guidelines for conducting written examination for persons with benchmark disabilities (i.e. with 40% or more disability, for whom the benefit of reservation in Government posts are allowed) on 29.08.2018 and corrigendum dated 08.02.2019 which inter-alia, provides for grant of scribe and compensatory time. Hon'ble Supreme Court in its order dated 11.02.2021 in the matter of Shri Vikash Kumar Vs UPSC and others has directed the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) to frame proper guidelines which would regulate and facilitate the grant of a facility of a scribe to persons with disability within the meaning of Section 2 (s) of the RPwD Act, 2016, where the nature of disability operates to impose a barrier to the candidate writing an examination. These guidelines should also prescribe appropriate norms to ensure that condition of the candidate is duly certified by such competent medical authority as may be prescribed so as to ensure that only genuine candidates in need of the facility are able to avail it. Keeping in view the above order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, an Expert Committee was constituted to consider the issue and suggest guidelines accordingly. The Committee noted that there are various types of clinical problems that can affect the writing capacity. After careful consideration of the matter, the Committee recommended that sole criteria for grant of scribe and compensatory time should be based on assessment of the capability of a person to write. The Committee accordingly recommended the following guidelines for conducting written examination for persons with specified disabilities covered under the definition of Section 2(s) of the RPwD Act,2016 but not covered under the definition of Section 2(r) of the said Act, i.e. persons having less than 40% disability and having difficulty in writing. The facility of scribe and/or compensatory time shall be granted solely to those having difficulty in writing subject to production of a certificate to the effect that person concerned has limitation to write and that scribe is essential to write examination on his/her behalf from the competent medical authority of a Government healthcare institution as per proforma at . The medical authority for the purpose of certification as mentioned in point above should be a multi-member authority comprising the following:- (* the Chief Medical Officer/Civil Surgeon/Chief District Medical Officer may make full efforts for inclusion of neurologists, occupational therapist from the nearest District or the Medical College/Institute, if the same is not available in the District)\" The candidate should have the discretion of opting for his own scribe or request the Examination Body for the same. The examination body may also identify the scribe to make panels at the District/Division/State level as per the requirements of the examination. In later instances the candidates should be allowed to meet the scribe two days before the examination so that the candidates get a chance to check and verify whether the scribe is suitable or not. In case the examination body provides the scribe, it shall be ensured that qualification of the scribe should not be more than the minimum qualification criteria of the examination. However, the qualification of the scribe should always be matriculate or above. In case the candidate is allowed to bring his own scribe, the qualification of the scribe should be one step below the qualification of the candidate taking examination. The person opting for own scribe should submit details of the own scribe as per proforma at . There should also be flexibility in accommodating any change in scribe in case of emergency. The candidates should also be allowed to take different scribe for writing different papers especially for languages. However, there can be only one scribe per subject. The candidate should be allowed to use aids and assistive devices such as prosthetics & orthotics, hearing aid as mentioned related to the certificate issued by medical authority as per Appendix I. Compensatory time not less than 20 minutes per hour of the examination should be allowed for persons who are eligible for getting scribe. In case the duration of the 3 examination is less than an hour, then the duration of the compensatory time should be allowed on pro-rata basis. Compensatory time should not be less than 5 minutes and should be in the multiple of 5. The examination bodies shall modify their application forms to incorporate specific needs of this category of persons. In case, any incident has been reported after filling up the form, the examination bodies shall inform the candidates to obtain medical certificate as per these guidelines for facilitating grant of scribe and/or compensatory time. As far as possible the examination for such persons may be held at ground floor. The examination centres should be accessible for persons with disabilities. (k) These guidelines are applicable to written examinations conducted by central recruitment agencies as well as academic institutions.

{"content": "Every year December 3 is observed as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. The annual observance of the International Day of Disabled Persons on December 3 was proclaimed in 1992, by the United Nations General Assembly resolution 47/3. The observance of the Day aims to promote an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights and well-being of persons with disabilities. It also seeks to increase awareness of gains to be derived from the integration of persons with disabilities in every aspect of political, social, economic and cultural life. The theme of the 2023 International Day of Persons with Disabilities is: \"United in action to rescue and achieve the SDGs for, with and by persons with disabilities\". Given the multiple crises of today’s world, achievement of the SDGs is in peril. At the mid-point of the implementation period for the 2030 Agenda, the world is not on track to reach numerous SDGs targets by 2030. For many, progress has either stalled or regressed below the 2015 baseline. Unfortunately, the world’s poorest and most vulnerable are often the hardest hit in times of crisis. Preliminary findings from the forthcoming UN Disability and Development Report 2023 indicate that the world is even more off track in meeting several SDGs for persons with disabilities. Our efforts to rescue the SDGs for, with and by persons with disabilities need to be intensified and accelerated, given that persons with disabilities have historically been marginalized and have often been among those left furthest behind. A fundamental shift in commitment, solidarity, financing and action is critical. Integral to this is the inclusion of the voices, needs and priorities of the global community of persons with disabilities in all their diversity. Encouragingly, with the adoption of the Political Declaration of the recent SDG Summit, world leaders have recommitted themselves to achieving sustainable development and shared prosperity for all, by focusing on policies and actions that target the poorest and most vulnerable, including persons with disabilities. Building on many decades of UN’s work in the field of disability, the , adopted in 2006, has further advanced the rights and well-being of persons with disabilities in the implementation of the and other international development frameworks, such as the , the , the , and the . A disability is a condition or function judged to be significantly impaired relative to the usual standard of an individual of their group. The term is often used to refer to individual functioning, including physical impairment, sensory impairment, cognitive impairment, intellectual impairment, mental illness, and various types of chronic disease. This usage has been described by some disabled people as being associated with a medical model of disability. Persons with disabilities, “the world’s largest minority”, have generally poorer health, lower education achievements, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty than people without disabilities. This is largely due to the lack of services available to them (like information and communications technology (ICT), justice or transportation) and the many obstacles they face in their everyday lives. These obstacles can take a variety of forms, including those relating to the physical environment, or those resulting from legislation or policy, or from societal attitudes or discrimination. On the occasion of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities i.e. 3rd December, the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment confers National Awards on Individuals, Institutions, Organizations, State/District etc for their outstanding achievements and work done towards empowerment of Persons with Disabilities every year.

{"content": "Every year December 3 is observed as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. The annual observance of the International Day of Disabled Persons on December 3 was proclaimed in 1992, by the United Nations General Assembly resolution 47/3. The observance of the Day aims to promote an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights and well-being of persons with disabilities. It also seeks to increase awareness of gains to be derived from the integration of persons with disabilities in every aspect of political, social, economic and cultural life. The theme of the 2023 International Day of Persons with Disabilities is: \"United in action to rescue and achieve the SDGs for, with and by persons with disabilities\". Given the multiple crises of today’s world, achievement of the SDGs is in peril. At the mid-point of the implementation period for the 2030 Agenda, the world is not on track to reach numerous SDGs targets by 2030. For many, progress has either stalled or regressed below the 2015 baseline. Unfortunately, the world’s poorest and most vulnerable are often the hardest hit in times of crisis. Preliminary findings from the forthcoming UN Disability and Development Report 2023 indicate that the world is even more off track in meeting several SDGs for persons with disabilities. Our efforts to rescue the SDGs for, with and by persons with disabilities need to be intensified and accelerated, given that persons with disabilities have historically been marginalized and have often been among those left furthest behind. A fundamental shift in commitment, solidarity, financing and action is critical. Integral to this is the inclusion of the voices, needs and priorities of the global community of persons with disabilities in all their diversity. Encouragingly, with the adoption of the Political Declaration of the recent SDG Summit, world leaders have recommitted themselves to achieving sustainable development and shared prosperity for all, by focusing on policies and actions that target the poorest and most vulnerable, including persons with disabilities. Building on many decades of UN’s work in the field of disability, the , adopted in 2006, has further advanced the rights and well-being of persons with disabilities in the implementation of the and other international development frameworks, such as the , the , the , and the . A disability is a condition or function judged to be significantly impaired relative to the usual standard of an individual of their group. The term is often used to refer to individual functioning, including physical impairment, sensory impairment, cognitive impairment, intellectual impairment, mental illness, and various types of chronic disease. This usage has been described by some disabled people as being associated with a medical model of disability. Persons with disabilities, “the world’s largest minority”, have generally poorer health, lower education achievements, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty than people without disabilities. This is largely due to the lack of services available to them (like information and communications technology (ICT), justice or transportation) and the many obstacles they face in their everyday lives. These obstacles can take a variety of forms, including those relating to the physical environment, or those resulting from legislation or policy, or from societal attitudes or discrimination. On the occasion of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities i.e. 3rd December, the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment confers National Awards on Individuals, Institutions, Organizations, State/District etc for their outstanding achievements and work done towards empowerment of Persons with Disabilities every year.

The resolution establishing the day acknowledges that early access to sign language and services in sign language, including quality education available in sign language, is vital to the growth and development of the deaf individual and critical to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals. It recognizes the importance of preserving sign languages as part of linguistic and cultural diversity.

{"content": "The United Nations General Assembly, through its resolution on 18th December 2007, unanimously declared 2 April as World Day to highlight the need to help improve the quality of life of those with autism so they can lead full and meaningful lives as an integral part of society. Autism is a lifelong neurological condition that manifests during early childhood, irrespective of gender, race or socio-economic status. The term Autism Spectrum refers to a range of characteristics. Appropriate support, accommodation and acceptance of this neurological variation allow those on the Spectrum to enjoy equal opportunity, and full and effective participation in society. Autism is mainly characterized by its unique social interactions, non-standard ways of learning, keen interests in specific subjects, inclination to routines, challenges in typical communications and particular ways of processing sensory information. The rate of autism in all regions of the world is high and the lack of understanding has a tremendous impact on the individuals, their families and communities. One in 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder, according to estimates by the UN World Health Organization. Around the world, one per cent of the entire population – possibly two per cent – is on the spectrum. In India, 1 out of 89 children born are said to be living with Autism. The stigmatization and discrimination associated with neurological differences remain substantial obstacles to diagnosis and therapies, an issue that must be addressed by both public policy-makers in developing nations, as well as donor countries. World Autism Awareness Day is a moment to recognize and celebrate the important contributions of autistic people in every country and community. But around the world, they continue to confront barriers to their fundamental rights to education, employment and social inclusion — as called for by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As a matter of fundamental rights, governments must invest in stronger community support systems, inclusive education and training programmes, and accessible and technology-based solutions to enable persons with autism to enjoy the same rights as others. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by world leaders at the United Nations in 2015 provide a blueprint for addressing the major challenges facing the world, including inequality. focuses on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all, as the foundation for improving people’s lives and reducing inequalities.

Autism is a lifelong neurological condition that manifests during early childhood, irrespective of gender, race or socio-economic status. The term Autism Spectrum refers to a range of characteristics. Appropriate support, accommodation and acceptance of this neurological variation allow those on the Spectrum to enjoy equal opportunity, and full and effective participation in society. Autism is mainly characterized by its unique social interactions, non-standard ways of learning, keen interests in specific subjects, inclination to routines, challenges in typical communications and particular ways of processing sensory information. The rate of autism in all regions of the world is high and the lack of understanding has a tremendous impact on the individuals, their families and communities. One in 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder, according to estimates by the UN World Health Organization. Around the world, one per cent of the entire population – possibly two per cent – is on the spectrum. In India, 1 out of 89 children born are said to be living with Autism. The stigmatization and discrimination associated with neurological differences remain substantial obstacles to diagnosis and therapies, an issue that must be addressed by both public policy-makers in developing nations, as well as donor countries. World Autism Awareness Day is a moment to recognize and celebrate the important contributions of autistic people in every country and community. But around the world, they continue to confront barriers to their fundamental rights to education, employment and social inclusion — as called for by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As a matter of fundamental rights, governments must invest in stronger community support systems, inclusive education and training programmes, and accessible and technology-based solutions to enable persons with autism to enjoy the same rights as others. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by world leaders at the United Nations in 2015 provide a blueprint for addressing the major challenges facing the world, including inequality. focuses on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all, as the foundation for improving people’s lives and reducing inequalities. The specific targets for SDG 4 refer to the need to ensure “equal access to all levels of education and vocational training” for persons with disabilities and building and upgrading education facilities that are disability sensitive and that provide “inclusive and effective learning environments for all.” In this respect, the SDGs echo the . Article 24 of the Convention recognizes that persons with disabilities have the right to inclusive, quality education on an equal basis with others and that reasonable accommodation of the individual’s requirements should be provided.

{"content": "A guardian is a person who is appointed to look after another person or his property. He or she assumes the care and protection of the person for whom he/she is appointed the guardian. The guardian takes all legal decisions on behalf of the person and the property of the ward. The occasion for taking care of another person may be his minority that is, a person who has not completed 18 years of age. It can also refer to guardianship of a person who because of physical and mental deficiencies is unable to take care of himself or his property. A guardian takes decision on behalf of the minor for protecting the interests of the minor and his property. Guardianship and Wards Act, 1890. Indian Contract Act-1872. Mental Health Act 2017 Persons with autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation and multiple disabilities are in a special situation as even after they have acquired 18 years of age, they may not always be capable of managing their own lives or taking legal decisions for their own betterment. Therefore, they may require someone to represent their interests in the legal areas throughout their lives. However, in cases of cerebral palsy and multiple disabilities, there may be a need for only limited guardianship because of the availability of enabling mechanisms and/ or scientific facilitations which enable such persons to function with varying degrees of independence. As per opinion of Disability Experts that NT Disabilities are conditions which cannot be cured and are not a disease. As per Legal Advice of ALA. Though it is not mandatory to apply for legal guardianship of a person with disability, since the National Trust Act, 1999 has made provision for such appointment it is always advantageous to apply for legal guardianship under the provisions of the said Act. Such occasion may arise when a person with disability has to deal with issues related to himself, his interests and his properties and since he/she may not always be able to take appropriate decisions in those respects, it would be in the best interests if represented by a legal guardian in such matters. Under section 14 of the National Trust Act, the Local Level Committee headed by the District Collector is empowered to receive application in Form A under Rule 16(1) & appoint guardians in Form B under Rule 16(2) for persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation & Multiple Disabilities.

Section 16 (2) state that “Every guardian shall also furnish to the said appointing authority within a period of three months at the close of every financial year, an account of the property and assets in his charge, the sums received and disbursed on account of the person with disability and the balance remaining with him”.

{"content": "The GST rates fixed for specific devices for physically challenged persons are as follows. GST rate for specified items for Physically Challenged Persons listed below, have been kept at the concessional 5% GST rate: Most of the inputs and raw materials for manufacture of these assistive devices/equipments attract 18% GST. The concessional 5% GST rate on these devices/equipments would enable their domestic manufacturers to avail Input Tax Credit of GST paid on their inputs and raw materials.  Further, the GST law provides for refund of accumulated Input Tax Credit, in cases, where the GST rate of output supply is lower than the GST rate on inputs used for their manufacture.  Therefore, 5% GST rate on these devices/equipments would enable their domestic manufacturers to claim refund of any accumulated Input Tax Credit.  That being so, the 5% concessional GST rate on these devices/equipment would result in reduction of the cost of domestically manufactured goods, as compared to the pre-GST regime. As against that, if these devices/equipments are exempted from GST, then while imports of such devices/equipments would be zero rated, domestically manufactured such devices/equipments will continue to bear the burden of input taxes, increasing their cost and resulting in negative protection for the domestic value addition. In fact, the 5% concessional GST rate on such devices/equipments will result in a win-win situation for both the users of such devices, the disabled persons, as well as the domestic manufacturers of such goods. It is for this reason that the Council has kept these items in 5% rate slab. Last Modified : 2/21/2020 This topic provides overview of Electronic Commerc...

{"content": "The umbrella Central Sector Scheme of this Ministry called the \"Scheme to Promote Voluntary Action for Persons with Disabilities\" was revised w.e.f. 01.04.2003 and was renamed as the \"Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS)\". However, while revision of the scheme took place in 2003, the cost norms of 1999 had remained unchanged. The revision of the cost norms has become imperative to compensate for the price rise. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Industrial workers has risen by 38% from 1999 to 2007. It has been decided to revise the cost norms for honoraria, recurring items and nonrecurring items of expenditure. The scheme has also been revised to the extent that there has been widening of the scope of the model projects. The approach of this Scheme is to provide financial assistance to voluntary organizations to make available the whole range of services necessary for rehabilitation of persons with disabilities including early intervention, development of daily living skills, education, skill-development oriented towards employability, training and awareness generation. With a view to inclusion of persons with disabilities in the mainstream of society and actualizing their potential, the thrust would be on education and training programmes. In order to achieve the objectives of the scheme the key strategies will be as follows: To facilitate delivery of various services to persons with disabilities by voluntary organizations, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is administering DDRS scheme and providing grants-in-aid to NGOs for the following projects:- The maximum level of support could be up to 90% of the eligible amount of grant for the project.

{"content": "One of the laudable features that the Founding  Fathers of the nation embedded in our  Constitution is Part XV Elections; that provides  for an Independent Election Commission,  Universal adult suffrage, maintenance of  electoral rolls and all the other fundamentals  for conduct of free, fair and inclusive elections.  These features have helped the polity evolve  into a vibrant and a rich democratic culture  marked by faith of Indian People in the  electoral exercise, its non partisan nature, and  with the basic tenet of 'No Voter should be  left behind.' - a perfect blend for inclusion  and the consequent everlasting determination  and endeavor for maximizing of the base of  democracy in India. Article 324 of the Constitution provides for the  Election Commission, its powers and functions  for maintenance of the Electoral Roll and  conduct of elections in a free and fair manner.  Article 325 provides that no person shall be  ineligible for inclusion in the electoral roll on  the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex  or anyone of these. Article 326 provides for  the Universal Adult Suffrage to be the basis  of elections. The concerned provisions of the  Constitution and the law that flows there from  cast an obligation on the Election Commission of India (ECI) for conduct of  free, fair and inclusive elections based on adult  suffrage. A larger recognition to the rights of ‘Persons  with Disability’ came from the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights and the United  Nations Convention of Rights of Persons with  Disabilities (CRPD) that stress upon respect  for inherent dignity, individual autonomy and  independence of voter, freedom to make one’s  own choice, full and effective participation and  inclusion in society, respect for difference and  acceptance of persons with disabilities as part of  human diversity and humanity, accessibility etc. 'The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act,  2016 defines a “person with disability” as  a person with long term physical, mental,  intellectual or sensory impairment which, in  interaction with barriers, hinders his full and effective participation in society equally with  others.' This would in effect mean inherent  barriers to inclusion of such persons in the  electoral process. Elections provide for exercise of choices  by the voters to elect their representatives  based on adult suffrage and it calls upon the  Election Machinery to provide for that The barriers in access to electoral participation  that may be perceived by the PwDs relate to  difficulties in voter registration, inaccessible  registration materials or facilities, inadequate  or inaccessible voter education and related  materials, difficulties in physical access to  polling stations, inability to vote independently  and privately, absence of or inappropriate  assistance from poll workers etc. The list is only  illustrative but in effect it means discouraging  PwDs from exercise of their right to franchise. Barriers do dissuade persons with disabilities  from voting. In a democracy in true spirit of universal  adult suffrage, every vote matters, every vote  counts. Given this fundamental premise,  equal access is vital to participation for PwDs.  The Barriers can be obliterated if they are  addressed appropriately and effectively under  a well designed Policy Framework. ECI’s broad policy framework on Accessible  Elections emanates from the guiding principles  and the mandate as discussed above. Further,  its Strategic Plan for 2016-25 spells out long  term the strategic interventions and the  current focus of in a continued endeavor  for enhancement of inclusion of PwDs as  an integral part of its election management  including voter education. Directions and Guidelines of the Commission Directions of the Commission on the subject  focus on the following broad areas in Election  Management and Planning: Voter education and Outreach for PwDs is an  integral part of the SVEEP Plans. Broad areas of  coverage are as below: ECI has implemented several measures to  ensure basic facilities at the polling stations  making them conducive for PwDs to cast their  vote. Some of them are as below Provided Basic Minimum Facilities (BMF) at the  Polling Station, such as ECI has announced a  series  of measures  for  facilitation of  PwDs,  which are  as follows.

{"content": "The Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, GoI in collaboration with Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) have introduced an index, to measure inclusiveness and accessibility of PwDs across different kinds of organisations. The composite index is split into two independent sub-indices that separately measure inclusiveness, and accessibility (I&A). The Inclusiveness and Accessibility Index (I&A Index) is not a substitute for the legal obligations that exist under national or international regulatory regimes. It aims at assessing the current stage of inclusiveness and accessibility of PwDs in an organisation and also acts as a guide for taking progressive steps to increase support, inclusiveness and accessibility towards persons / employees with disabilities. The toolkit is designed as a maturity model with measurable steps defined as 'indicators' to enable an organisation to progressively improve its ranking on the Inclusiveness and Accessibility Index. The methodology for determining the position of an organisation on the inclusiveness and accessibility index is as follows: For More Information on To facilitate measurement of this index, a questionnaire has been designed to assess an organisation's standing on the I&A Index. The questionnaire is designed to enable the assessor to give appropriate ratings to individual organisations that choose to be assessed. The questionnaire also has two sections applicable to the two indices: Inclusiveness and Accessibility. Each section has three key components. Questions can be easily answered by an organisation by ticking the appropriate parameters that are applicable. However, care must be taken that each 'tick' mark is substantiated with credible evidence. for measurement of I & A index Last Modified : 11/22/2023 This topic provides information about the Standard...

{"content": "A guardian is a person who is appointed to look after another person or his property. He or she assumes the care and protection of the person for whom he/she is appointed the guardian. The guardian takes all legal decisions on behalf of the person and the property of the ward. The occasion for taking care of another person may be his minority that is, a person who has not completed 18 years of age. It can also refer to guardianship of a person who because of physical and mental deficiencies is unable to take care of himself or his property. A guardian takes decision on behalf of the minor for protecting the interests of the minor and his property. Guardianship and Wards Act, 1890. Indian Contract Act-1872. Mental Health Act 2017 Persons with autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation and multiple disabilities are in a special situation as even after they have acquired 18 years of age, they may not always be capable of managing their own lives or taking legal decisions for their own betterment. Therefore, they may require someone to represent their interests in the legal areas throughout their lives. However, in cases of cerebral palsy and multiple disabilities, there may be a need for only limited guardianship because of the availability of enabling mechanisms and/ or scientific facilitations which enable such persons to function with varying degrees of independence. As per opinion of Disability Experts that NT Disabilities are conditions which cannot be cured and are not a disease. As per Legal Advice of ALA. Though it is not mandatory to apply for legal guardianship of a person with disability, since the National Trust Act, 1999 has made provision for such appointment it is always advantageous to apply for legal guardianship under the provisions of the said Act. Such occasion may arise when a person with disability has to deal with issues related to himself, his interests and his properties and since he/she may not always be able to take appropriate decisions in those respects, it would be in the best interests if represented by a legal guardian in such matters.

Section 16 (2) state that “Every guardian shall also furnish to the said appointing authority within a period of three months at the close of every financial year, an account of the property and assets in his charge, the sums received and disbursed on account of the person with disability and the balance remaining with him”. Form A under National Trust Rules is to be filled in for applying for legal guardianship. To access the Form A, The application is to be processed by a Local Level Committee (LLC).

{"content": "The GST rates fixed for specific devices for physically challenged persons are as follows. GST rate for specified items for Physically Challenged Persons listed below, have been kept at the concessional 5% GST rate: Most of the inputs and raw materials for manufacture of these assistive devices/equipments attract 18% GST. The concessional 5% GST rate on these devices/equipments would enable their domestic manufacturers to avail Input Tax Credit of GST paid on their inputs and raw materials.  Further, the GST law provides for refund of accumulated Input Tax Credit, in cases, where the GST rate of output supply is lower than the GST rate on inputs used for their manufacture.  Therefore, 5% GST rate on these devices/equipments would enable their domestic manufacturers to claim refund of any accumulated Input Tax Credit.  That being so, the 5% concessional GST rate on these devices/equipment would result in reduction of the cost of domestically manufactured goods, as compared to the pre-GST regime. As against that, if these devices/equipments are exempted from GST, then while imports of such devices/equipments would be zero rated, domestically manufactured such devices/equipments will continue to bear the burden of input taxes, increasing their cost and resulting in negative protection for the domestic value addition. In fact, the 5% concessional GST rate on such devices/equipments will result in a win-win situation for both the users of such devices, the disabled persons, as well as the domestic manufacturers of such goods. It is for this reason that the Council has kept these items in 5% rate slab. Last Modified : 2/21/2020 Scheme of West Bengal to assist validly registered...

{"content": "The umbrella Central Sector Scheme of this Ministry called the \"Scheme to Promote Voluntary Action for Persons with Disabilities\" was revised w.e.f. 01.04.2003 and was renamed as the \"Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS)\". However, while revision of the scheme took place in 2003, the cost norms of 1999 had remained unchanged. The revision of the cost norms has become imperative to compensate for the price rise. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Industrial workers has risen by 38% from 1999 to 2007. It has been decided to revise the cost norms for honoraria, recurring items and nonrecurring items of expenditure. The scheme has also been revised to the extent that there has been widening of the scope of the model projects. The approach of this Scheme is to provide financial assistance to voluntary organizations to make available the whole range of services necessary for rehabilitation of persons with disabilities including early intervention, development of daily living skills, education, skill-development oriented towards employability, training and awareness generation. With a view to inclusion of persons with disabilities in the mainstream of society and actualizing their potential, the thrust would be on education and training programmes. In order to achieve the objectives of the scheme the key strategies will be as follows: To facilitate delivery of various services to persons with disabilities by voluntary organizations, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is administering DDRS scheme and providing grants-in-aid to NGOs for the following projects:- The maximum level of support could be up to 90% of the eligible amount of grant for the project.

{"content": "One of the laudable features that the Founding  Fathers of the nation embedded in our  Constitution is Part XV Elections; that provides  for an Independent Election Commission,  Universal adult suffrage, maintenance of  electoral rolls and all the other fundamentals  for conduct of free, fair and inclusive elections.  These features have helped the polity evolve  into a vibrant and a rich democratic culture  marked by faith of Indian People in the  electoral exercise, its non partisan nature, and  with the basic tenet of 'No Voter should be  left behind.' - a perfect blend for inclusion  and the consequent everlasting determination  and endeavor for maximizing of the base of  democracy in India. Article 324 of the Constitution provides for the  Election Commission, its powers and functions  for maintenance of the Electoral Roll and  conduct of elections in a free and fair manner.  Article 325 provides that no person shall be  ineligible for inclusion in the electoral roll on  the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex  or anyone of these. Article 326 provides for  the Universal Adult Suffrage to be the basis  of elections. The concerned provisions of the  Constitution and the law that flows there from  cast an obligation on the Election Commission of India (ECI) for conduct of  free, fair and inclusive elections based on adult  suffrage. A larger recognition to the rights of ‘Persons  with Disability’ came from the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights and the United  Nations Convention of Rights of Persons with  Disabilities (CRPD) that stress upon respect  for inherent dignity, individual autonomy and  independence of voter, freedom to make one’s  own choice, full and effective participation and  inclusion in society, respect for difference and  acceptance of persons with disabilities as part of  human diversity and humanity, accessibility etc. 'The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act,  2016 defines a “person with disability” as  a person with long term physical, mental,  intellectual or sensory impairment which, in  interaction with barriers, hinders his full and effective participation in society equally with  others.' This would in effect mean inherent  barriers to inclusion of such persons in the  electoral process. Elections provide for exercise of choices  by the voters to elect their representatives  based on adult suffrage and it calls upon the  Election Machinery to provide for that The barriers in access to electoral participation  that may be perceived by the PwDs relate to  difficulties in voter registration, inaccessible  registration materials or facilities, inadequate  or inaccessible voter education and related  materials, difficulties in physical access to  polling stations, inability to vote independently  and privately, absence of or inappropriate  assistance from poll workers etc. The list is only  illustrative but in effect it means discouraging  PwDs from exercise of their right to franchise. Barriers do dissuade persons with disabilities  from voting. In a democracy in true spirit of universal  adult suffrage, every vote matters, every vote  counts. Given this fundamental premise,  equal access is vital to participation for PwDs.  The Barriers can be obliterated if they are  addressed appropriately and effectively under  a well designed Policy Framework. ECI’s broad policy framework on Accessible  Elections emanates from the guiding principles  and the mandate as discussed above. Further,  its Strategic Plan for 2016-25 spells out long  term the strategic interventions and the  current focus of in a continued endeavor  for enhancement of inclusion of PwDs as  an integral part of its election management  including voter education. Directions and Guidelines of the Commission Directions of the Commission on the subject  focus on the following broad areas in Election  Management and Planning: Voter education and Outreach for PwDs is an  integral part of the SVEEP Plans. Broad areas of  coverage are as below: ECI has implemented several measures to  ensure basic facilities at the polling stations  making them conducive for PwDs to cast their  vote. Some of them are as below Provided Basic Minimum Facilities (BMF) at the  Polling Station, such as ECI has announced a  series  of measures  for  facilitation of  PwDs,  which are  as follows.

{"content": "One of the laudable features that the Founding  Fathers of the nation embedded in our  Constitution is Part XV Elections; that provides  for an Independent Election Commission,  Universal adult suffrage, maintenance of  electoral rolls and all the other fundamentals  for conduct of free, fair and inclusive elections.  These features have helped the polity evolve  into a vibrant and a rich democratic culture  marked by faith of Indian People in the  electoral exercise, its non partisan nature, and  with the basic tenet of 'No Voter should be  left behind.' - a perfect blend for inclusion  and the consequent everlasting determination  and endeavor for maximizing of the base of  democracy in India. Article 324 of the Constitution provides for the  Election Commission, its powers and functions  for maintenance of the Electoral Roll and  conduct of elections in a free and fair manner.  Article 325 provides that no person shall be  ineligible for inclusion in the electoral roll on  the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex  or anyone of these. Article 326 provides for  the Universal Adult Suffrage to be the basis  of elections. The concerned provisions of the  Constitution and the law that flows there from  cast an obligation on the Election Commission of India (ECI) for conduct of  free, fair and inclusive elections based on adult  suffrage. A larger recognition to the rights of ‘Persons  with Disability’ came from the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights and the United  Nations Convention of Rights of Persons with  Disabilities (CRPD) that stress upon respect  for inherent dignity, individual autonomy and  independence of voter, freedom to make one’s  own choice, full and effective participation and  inclusion in society, respect for difference and  acceptance of persons with disabilities as part of  human diversity and humanity, accessibility etc. 'The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act,  2016 defines a “person with disability” as  a person with long term physical, mental,  intellectual or sensory impairment which, in  interaction with barriers, hinders his full and effective participation in society equally with  others.' This would in effect mean inherent  barriers to inclusion of such persons in the  electoral process. Elections provide for exercise of choices  by the voters to elect their representatives  based on adult suffrage and it calls upon the  Election Machinery to provide for that The barriers in access to electoral participation  that may be perceived by the PwDs relate to  difficulties in voter registration, inaccessible  registration materials or facilities, inadequate  or inaccessible voter education and related  materials, difficulties in physical access to  polling stations, inability to vote independently  and privately, absence of or inappropriate  assistance from poll workers etc. The list is only  illustrative but in effect it means discouraging  PwDs from exercise of their right to franchise. Barriers do dissuade persons with disabilities  from voting. In a democracy in true spirit of universal  adult suffrage, every vote matters, every vote  counts. Given this fundamental premise,  equal access is vital to participation for PwDs.  The Barriers can be obliterated if they are  addressed appropriately and effectively under  a well designed Policy Framework. ECI’s broad policy framework on Accessible  Elections emanates from the guiding principles  and the mandate as discussed above. Further,  its Strategic Plan for 2016-25 spells out long  term the strategic interventions and the  current focus of in a continued endeavor  for enhancement of inclusion of PwDs as  an integral part of its election management  including voter education. Directions and Guidelines of the Commission Directions of the Commission on the subject  focus on the following broad areas in Election  Management and Planning: Voter education and Outreach for PwDs is an  integral part of the SVEEP Plans. Broad areas of  coverage are as below: ECI has implemented several measures to  ensure basic facilities at the polling stations  making them conducive for PwDs to cast their  vote. Some of them are as below Provided Basic Minimum Facilities (BMF) at the  Polling Station, such as ECI has announced a  series  of measures  for  facilitation of  PwDs,  which are  as follows.

{"content": "One of the laudable features that the Founding  Fathers of the nation embedded in our  Constitution is Part XV Elections; that provides  for an Independent Election Commission,  Universal adult suffrage, maintenance of  electoral rolls and all the other fundamentals  for conduct of free, fair and inclusive elections.  These features have helped the polity evolve  into a vibrant and a rich democratic culture  marked by faith of Indian People in the  electoral exercise, its non partisan nature, and  with the basic tenet of 'No Voter should be  left behind.' - a perfect blend for inclusion  and the consequent everlasting determination  and endeavor for maximizing of the base of  democracy in India. Article 324 of the Constitution provides for the  Election Commission, its powers and functions  for maintenance of the Electoral Roll and  conduct of elections in a free and fair manner.  Article 325 provides that no person shall be  ineligible for inclusion in the electoral roll on  the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex  or anyone of these. Article 326 provides for  the Universal Adult Suffrage to be the basis  of elections. The concerned provisions of the  Constitution and the law that flows there from  cast an obligation on the Election Commission of India (ECI) for conduct of  free, fair and inclusive elections based on adult  suffrage. A larger recognition to the rights of ‘Persons  with Disability’ came from the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights and the United  Nations Convention of Rights of Persons with  Disabilities (CRPD) that stress upon respect  for inherent dignity, individual autonomy and  independence of voter, freedom to make one’s  own choice, full and effective participation and  inclusion in society, respect for difference and  acceptance of persons with disabilities as part of  human diversity and humanity, accessibility etc. 'The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act,  2016 defines a “person with disability” as  a person with long term physical, mental,  intellectual or sensory impairment which, in  interaction with barriers, hinders his full and effective participation in society equally with  others.' This would in effect mean inherent  barriers to inclusion of such persons in the  electoral process. Elections provide for exercise of choices  by the voters to elect their representatives  based on adult suffrage and it calls upon the  Election Machinery to provide for that The barriers in access to electoral participation  that may be perceived by the PwDs relate to  difficulties in voter registration, inaccessible  registration materials or facilities, inadequate  or inaccessible voter education and related  materials, difficulties in physical access to  polling stations, inability to vote independently  and privately, absence of or inappropriate  assistance from poll workers etc. The list is only  illustrative but in effect it means discouraging  PwDs from exercise of their right to franchise. Barriers do dissuade persons with disabilities  from voting. In a democracy in true spirit of universal  adult suffrage, every vote matters, every vote  counts. Given this fundamental premise,  equal access is vital to participation for PwDs.  The Barriers can be obliterated if they are  addressed appropriately and effectively under  a well designed Policy Framework. ECI’s broad policy framework on Accessible  Elections emanates from the guiding principles  and the mandate as discussed above.

{"content": "A guardian is a person who is appointed to look after another person or his property. He or she assumes the care and protection of the person for whom he/she is appointed the guardian. The guardian takes all legal decisions on behalf of the person and the property of the ward. The occasion for taking care of another person may be his minority that is, a person who has not completed 18 years of age. It can also refer to guardianship of a person who because of physical and mental deficiencies is unable to take care of himself or his property. A guardian takes decision on behalf of the minor for protecting the interests of the minor and his property. Guardianship and Wards Act, 1890. Indian Contract Act-1872. Mental Health Act 2017 Persons with autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation and multiple disabilities are in a special situation as even after they have acquired 18 years of age, they may not always be capable of managing their own lives or taking legal decisions for their own betterment. Therefore, they may require someone to represent their interests in the legal areas throughout their lives. However, in cases of cerebral palsy and multiple disabilities, there may be a need for only limited guardianship because of the availability of enabling mechanisms and/ or scientific facilitations which enable such persons to function with varying degrees of independence. As per opinion of Disability Experts that NT Disabilities are conditions which cannot be cured and are not a disease. As per Legal Advice of ALA. Though it is not mandatory to apply for legal guardianship of a person with disability, since the National Trust Act, 1999 has made provision for such appointment it is always advantageous to apply for legal guardianship under the provisions of the said Act. Such occasion may arise when a person with disability has to deal with issues related to himself, his interests and his properties and since he/she may not always be able to take appropriate decisions in those respects, it would be in the best interests if represented by a legal guardian in such matters.

In percentage terms, this stands at 2.21 %. There has been a marginal increase in the differently-abled population in India, with the figure rising from 21.9 million in 2001 to 26.8 million in 10 years. There are 14.9 million men with disabilities as compared to 11.8 million women in the country. The total number of differently-abled people is over 18 million in the rural areas and just 8.1 million enumerated in the urban settings. The percentage of men with disabilities is 2.41 as against 2.01 in women. Social groups wise analysis shows, 2.45 per cent of the total disabled population belong to the Scheduled Castes, 2.05 to the Scheduled Tribes and 2.18 per cent to other than SC/ST. Even among these two social groups, the proportion of men with disabilities is higher as compared to women. State-wise data shows, , Maharashtra, Orissa and Jammu and Kashmir have more than 2.51 per cent disabled population whereas in , Assam, Meghalaya, Assam and Nagaland, the percentage is less than 1.75. For State/ UT wise Persons with Disability statistics, Over 5.4 million people have some kind of physical disability, followed by hearing impairment affecting 5.07 million and 5.03 million who have problems with their vision. Just about 2 million have speech disability, and 2 million are affected by mental retardation and other mental illnesses. The proportion of women suffering from seeing, hearing and multiple disabilities is higher than men. Disability in seeing, hearing and movement and multiple disability is more among STs than SCs and others while disability in speech and mental retardation is more among others than SC/ST. Age-wise break-up of the data suggests disability is more among people aged 80 years and above, and the least among children aged up to 4 years. Disability among STs in lower age groups up to 40-49 years is significantly lower than the other social groups whereas in the higher age group (60 plus), it is high among STs. Census 2011 data on Disabled Population in the age-group 5-19 by their Attendance Status in Educational Institutions and type of Disability indicates that there are about 65.7 lakh disabled population in age-group 5-19, out of which 40.2 lakh (61.2%) are attending educational institutions, 8.0 lakh (12.1%) attended educational institutions earlier and 17.5 lakh (26.7%) never attended any educational institutions. Further, out of 40.2 lakh disabled persons attending educational institutions, 22.8 lakh (56.7%) are males and 17.4 lakh (43.3%) are females. As such, there is an improvement of about 11 percentage points in the status of attending educational institutions by disabled persons in the age-group 5-19 during the decade 2001-2011.

The Constitution of India ensures equality, freedom, justice and dignity of all individuals and implicitly mandates an inclusive society for all, including persons with disabilities.
